SCHOOL</h1>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>EXPELLING A PUPIL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What are you looking so glum about this
morning, Stumpy?&rdquo; asked Ned Wilding as he
greeted his chum, Fenn Masterson, otherwise
known as &ldquo;Stumpy&rdquo; because of his short, stout
figure. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got your lessons, or are
you going to be expelled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to be expelled but some one else is,
Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Some one going to be expelled?&rdquo;
asked Bart Keene, coming up in time to
hear what Fenn said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Newton is,&rdquo; replied Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with you?&rdquo; asked
Bart, for, as had Ned, he noticed that Fenn looked
worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have something to do with me if
John&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Just then the bell of the Darewell High School
began to ring, and, as it was the final summons
to classes the three boys and several other pupils
hurried into the building. On the way up the
stairs Ned Wilding was joined by a tall youth
with dark hair and eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear about John Newton?&rdquo;
asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Frank! Why Stumpy says John&rsquo;s got
to leave the school, but it&rsquo;s the first I heard about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they going to expel him this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems so. We&rsquo;ll soon know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later several hundred boys and girls
were gathered in the auditorium of the school for
the usual morning exercises. When they were
over the principal, Professor McCloud, came to
the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a very unpleasant duty to perform,&rdquo;
he began.</p>

<p>Most of the boys and girls knew what was coming.
The principal never prefaced his remarks
that way unless he had to expel a pupil. Ned and
Bart looked over toward where Fenn sat. They
wanted to see if there was any reason for Stumpy&rsquo;s
seeming apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Newton!&rdquo; called Professor McCloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and a tall youth, with eyes that squinted slightly,
left his seat and shambled forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming now,&rdquo; whispered Fenn, and Frank
Roscoe, who was sitting beside him, looked at his
chum and wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one would think it was you who had
to face the music,&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>By this time John Newton was standing in
front of the raised platform on which the principal
and teachers sat during the morning exercises.
He did not seem to mind the humility or disgrace
of his position. He turned half around and
looked toward Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he says anything&mdash;&rdquo; began Stumpy, whispering
to himself, but he did not finish the sentence
for Professor McCloud was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Newton,&rdquo; the principal said, &ldquo;I am
deeply grieved that I have to do this. It is very
painful.&rdquo; It was the same speech the pupils had
heard before. The principal always used it, with
such slight variations as might be necessary.
&ldquo;You have been dilatory in your studies. You
have been insubordinate. You have played mean
tricks. You have refused to mend your ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principal took a long breath. He always
did at this particular point in his painful duty.
But this time there was a variation from the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
scene. John Newton stepped forward and addressed
the principal. It was a thing unheard
of in the Darewell school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor McCloud,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I want to
say that while I&rsquo;m partly to blame in this matter,
Fenn Mas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do! That will do!&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. McCloud so sharply that John started. A
number of the pupils turned in their seats to
gaze at Stumpy, who looked painfully self-conscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in the wind,&rdquo; whispered
Ned to Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take all the blame,&rdquo; persisted
John, ignoring the principal&rsquo;s command to
remain silent. &ldquo;Fenn Mast&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that would do,&rdquo; and Mr. McCloud
spoke so decisively that John remained silent. &ldquo;I
know what you would say,&rdquo; the professor went on.
&ldquo;I have looked into that matter thoroughly. No
one is to blame but yourself, and your effort to shift
the punishment to some other boy does not do
you any good. You should not have attempted to
mention any pupil&rsquo;s name. I will not refer to it
again, except to say that no one is involved but
yourself. I am fully satisfied on this point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank noticed that Fenn seemed much relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at the professor&rsquo;s announcement, and he wondered
what connection there could have been between his
chum and John Newton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been given several opportunities to
reform,&rdquo; the principal went on, &ldquo;but you have refused
to profit by them. You are a dangerous element
to have in this school. Therefore, we return
you to your friends,&rdquo; and, with a wave of his
glasses toward the door to emphasize his remark,
the principal indicated that John Newton might
go. That ended it. John was expelled.</p>

<p>The pupils went to their various classes, and,
though there was considerable whispering back and
forth during the morning session as to what caused
John&rsquo;s expulsion, and what his reference to Fenn
might mean, there was no chance to discuss the
matter until the noon recess. Then questions and
answers flew thick and fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Fenn, tell us all about it,&rdquo; said Ned
Wilding when he and the two other boys who
had remarked Stumpy&rsquo;s apprehension, were gathered
in the basement where lunches were usually
eaten. &ldquo;What was John driving at? What were
you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear Professor McCloud say it
was all ended and he was satisfied I had no hand
in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that doesn&rsquo;t satisfy us,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;We want the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to it,&rdquo; Fenn declared.
&ldquo;You must promise not to repeat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll promise but I guess John will tell it
all over town,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know John and I used to be pretty
friendly,&rdquo; Fenn began, getting his chums off into
a corner. &ldquo;He lives near me and I used to go
fishing with him once in a while. But he got
down on me because I wouldn&rsquo;t lend him my best
reel one day, though for a while I didn&rsquo;t know
he wasn&rsquo;t friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always playing some kind of tricks in
school, but most of &rsquo;em aren&rsquo;t any worse than
those we get up. But this last one was the limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been reading some book on India, and
how they catch tigers by smearing bird-lime on the
leaves near the water-hole. He made some of the
lime. I helped him. Got some of the stuff from
the laboratory. Then he put it all over the papers
in Mr. McCloud&rsquo;s desk, one night after school,
and they got so fastened together they couldn&rsquo;t be
separated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you helped him do
that?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I did? I only helped make the
bird-lime. He told me we could catch rabbits
with it. I didn&rsquo;t know what he was up to or I
wouldn&rsquo;t have done that much. When he learned
he was discovered, for he left his knife in the
desk, he said he was going to make me take part
of the blame for helping him make the lime.
That&rsquo;s what I was afraid of this morning, when I
heard he was going to be expelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did try to give you away,&rdquo; interrupted
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather mean, too. But it seems Mr. McCloud
had been investigating, though I didn&rsquo;t
know it. He must have found out that I didn&rsquo;t
have any hand in putting the stuff in the desk, even
if I did help John make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky for you that he did,&rdquo; commented Ned.
&ldquo;Do you think John will try to do anything more
to make trouble for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Fenn replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was always up to tricks,&rdquo; commented
Frank. &ldquo;Once he daubed tar on the bottoms of
his shoes and walked through the classroom, leaving
black marks all over. He pasted paper caps
on the pestle when the chemistry class was going
to recite and Professor Long thought the powder
he was mixing went off at the wrong time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and do you remember the time he whistled
like a bird in school,&rdquo; put in Ned, &ldquo;and
made the teacher believe a canary was loose somewhere.
My, but he can whistle!&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;He can do as well as some of the fellows on
the stage. I&rsquo;m sorry he got expelled, but I&rsquo;m
glad you&rsquo;re out of it, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE WRONG SLIDE</h3>


<p>The four boys spent some time discussing the
affair of the morning, and speculating as to what
John Newton would do now that he could no
longer attend school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;ll not worry much,&rdquo; remarked Fenn.
&ldquo;He was saying the other day he thought he&rsquo;d
go off somewhere and try to get work in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work? He&rsquo;s too lazy to work,&rdquo; put in Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d like to get a job in a theater,&rdquo;
Fenn added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoving scenery around, or being part of the
mob in Julius Cæsar would be his limit, I guess,&rdquo;
said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Cæsar reminds me that Fenn fell
down in his Latin this morning,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should have boned away on it last
night but I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know why,&rdquo; put in Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw you out walking with Jennie Smith, and
I s&rsquo;pose you didn&rsquo;t get in until late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she recite poetry to you?&rdquo; asked Frank,
for Jennie was somewhat inclined to verse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say you fellows dry up!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare walk with a girl. Don&rsquo;t know
how to behave in company!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes Fenn to please the girls,&rdquo; retorted
Ned, and he dodged to escape a blow Stumpy
aimed at him. Then the gong rang for the afternoon
session and the pupils went back to their classrooms.</p>

<p>While the boys are at their lessons, which is
about the only time, save when they are asleep,
that they are not talking or doing something, there
will be opportunity of telling who they are.</p>

<p>Ned Wilding&rsquo;s mother had been dead some
years. His father was cashier in the only bank in
Darewell, a thriving manufacturing town not far
from Lake Erie. The Still river ran through the
place and it was a journey of about ten miles to
the lake on that stream.</p>

<p>Frank Roscoe lived with his uncle Abner Dent,
who was a wealthy farmer, residing on the outskirts
of the town. Frank had been with his relative
as long as he could remember. He never
knew his father or mother, and his uncle never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mentioned them. The boy had been brought up
with the idea that both his parents were dead.
He was a manly youth, but there was a certain
strangeness and an air of mystery about him. It
was puzzling to his comrades, though they liked
him none the less for it.</p>

<p>As for Bart Keene, it would be hard to find
a finer specimen of American boy. He was stout
and sturdy, and would rather play ball than eat.
His father, who was proprietor of a large factory,
used to say Bart talked sports in his sleep. Bart
had a sister Alice, as gentle as he was rough,
though his roughness was not at all offensive. She
had an idea she would like to be a trained nurse,
and used every opportunity of practicing for her
chosen profession. Let any one cut his finger, or
run a sliver into it and Alice would exclaim:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let me bandage it up! I&rsquo;m so glad it
happened&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;I mean it&rsquo;s
such good practice for me!&rdquo; Then she would
hustle around for salve and strips of cloth and render
first-aid-to-the-injured after the most approved
fashion.</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t help liking Fenn Masterson.
&ldquo;Stumpy&rdquo; was the jolliest chap in seven counties,
his friends used to say, and, it seemed with truth.
He had blue eyes that always seemed to be laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at you, as though his very figure, about as
broad as it was long, was the best joke in the
world.</p>

<p>But Fenn was not proud of his shape. He
often deplored it, especially when he went walking
with a girl, which he did whenever he got the
chance. Stumpy was fond of the girls, and some
of them liked him,&mdash;especially Jennie Smith already
mentioned. She used to confide to her
chum, Alice Keene, that Fenn reminded her somewhat
of Falstaff, whom you can read about in
Shakespeare, if you wish.</p>

<p>The boys had been chums all through the grammar
school and their friendship was further cemented
when they continued on at the high school.
They were four of the best-liked boys in the institution,
and the leaders when it came to sport,
fun or doings of any sort. They were generally
seen together and if anything was undertaken the
&ldquo;Darewell Chums,&rdquo; as they were called from the
name of the town, were sure to be found in the
van.</p>

<p>The boys lived in the same neighborhood in the
better part of the place, all save Frank, whose
uncle&rsquo;s house was about a mile outside the town,
but on the same highway on which his chums resided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Going home from school that afternoon the four
chums saw John Newton standing on a street
corner. As they passed him John called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey Stumpy, I want to speak to you a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn dropped behind his chums and spoke to
John for some time. Ned, Bart and Frank walked
on, and then waited for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he going to pay you off?&rdquo; asked Ned, as
Fenn joined his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he wanted to tell me he was sorry he tried
to throw the blame on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for him, Stumpy,&rdquo; advised Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh John is thoughtless, but he doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything bad,&rdquo; Fenn said. &ldquo;I guess this was
quite a lesson for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In school the next afternoon Frank, Bart and
Fenn each received a note from Ned, the papers
being passed along in that mysterious postal fashion
which prevails in all schools. The missives read:</p>

<p class="noi blockquot">&ldquo;Watch for some fun at the science lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a talk given every Friday afternoon
by Professor Long, who used stereoptican slides.
The lecture was usually on some popular topic.</p>

<p>It was quite a large class that assembled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
darkened laboratory at the last period of the afternoon.
The professor began his talk. It was
about volcanoes, and he described their formation,
the theories regarding them, and the causes
for their terrific action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will now throw on the screen,&rdquo; the instructor
said, &ldquo;a picture of Mt. Vesuvius in full action.
It is a wonderful view of a wonderful phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s delay, and he slipped a
slide into the lantern. Ned nudged his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>The next instant there was shown on the screen
a picture of a boy setting off a giant fire-cracker
under the chair of a sleeping man, who was depicted
in the act of rising high into the air under
the propulsion of the pyrotechnic. It was an irruption,
but one not down on the program.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A QUEER CHARACTER</h3>


<p>A chorus of laughter broke out among the
students. It certainly was mirth-provoking to see
that picture in place of the fire and clouds of
smoke from the volcano. The class was in an uproar.</p>

<p>Professor Long waited patiently until the noise
had subsided. He even allowed the wrong slide
to remain on the screen. The boys finally ceased
laughing. Then the instructor spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume that was done as a joke,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If so I think it was a very poor one. I don&rsquo;t
mind fun, but I like it in the right place. A
certain amount is good, even in the schoolroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was sarcastic now, and Ned began to
feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You young gentlemen,&rdquo; and he seemed to hesitate
at the word, &ldquo;you young gentlemen are sent
here to learn. If you can do so and have fun,
all right. I am paid by the city to teach you.
I am expected to put a certain amount of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
into your brains. I can&rsquo;t unless you let
me. I&rsquo;m not a magician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be interested in this lecture.
It seems you would rather have a lot of
horse-play and rowdyism instead. If I had known
that I might have provided a different set of pictures.
But not in school hours. The school authorities
expect me to instruct you in physics and
chemistry; not in foolishness. Young gentlemen,
the lecture is over, but you can remain in your seats
in the darkness until the usual hour for dismissing
the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a different ending to the joke than Ned
had anticipated. It was he who had put the
wrong slide in with the others, having had access
to the laboratory that morning. There were several
murmurs from the boys not in on the plot.
They did not relish sitting in the darkness for half
an hour.</p>

<p>Professor Long began putting away the apparatus.
He withdrew the firecracker slide and
turned out the stereopticon. Then Ned did a
manly thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Long,&rdquo; he called, out of the darkness.
&ldquo;I want to apologize to you and the class.
I put the wrong picture into the pile. I&rsquo;m sorry
and I&rsquo;ll not do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>A silence ensued. The boys wondered at Ned&rsquo;s
pluck in acknowledging his fault. But then he
and his chums were that kind of boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t excuse your conduct under any circumstances,
Wilding,&rdquo; said Professor Long, sternly.
&ldquo;Still I will admit I like your manliness in admitting
your fault. In view of what you have
said, and as it is evident the other boys had no
hand in it, I will go on with the lecture. But I
must ask you to withdraw, and, as a punishment
you will write out fifty lines of Cæsar after school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a task that made some of the boys catch
their breaths. But Ned felt he deserved it, though
he said to himself the joke was worth it. He left
the laboratory, and the lecture went on. He remained
after school and completed his penance.
Professor Long, who had some experiments to prepare
for the next week&rsquo;s work, had also stayed
after school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it again, Wilding,&rdquo; was all he said,
and Ned was almost sure he saw the teacher
smile.</p>

<p>Ned found his chums waiting for him. They
were a little diffident about referring to the joke,
but Ned had no such scruples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a sort of a boomerang,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;I spent fifty cents getting that slide, and to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
how it turned out! Long is pretty touchy when it
comes to his lectures. I guess I&rsquo;ll not monkey with
&rsquo;em again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you missed a lot of fun,&rdquo; said Frank
slowly. &ldquo;He told us a lot of interesting stuff
about volcanoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet none of &rsquo;em could match mine,&rdquo; came
from Ned, with a laugh. &ldquo;Mine was up-to-date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you going to do to-morrow?&rdquo; asked
Bart of his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we arrange a ball game?&rdquo; inquired
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to but couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Supposing
we all go fishing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; was the general cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, meet at the Point, with lines and
poles, at nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow and we&rsquo;ll go to the
Riffles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Point was a tongue of land extending out
into the river about a mile above the town. It
was a favorite place for swimming as there was a
sort of sandy beach there. The Riffles were a
series of shallow spots about two miles above the
point, and from there on up was good fishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The river near the Riffles ran through a dense
woods which were seldom visited.</p>

<p>Promptly on time the boys were at the meeting
place. They had with them everything needed
for a day&rsquo;s fishing, from bait and poles to a lunch
for themselves, as they did not intend coming back
until afternoon.</p>

<p>The boys tramped through the woods toward
the fishing holes, which they had often visited.
They were talking of the events of the previous
day at school, and Ned was explaining over again
how he substituted the wrong picture slide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, where are you boys going?&rdquo; a voice
suddenly hailed them from the bushes that lined
the path they were traveling.</p>

<p>They looked up, to see an old man, with a white
straggling beard, which fell almost to his waist,
peering at them. He was half hidden by the
underbrush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishing,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up at the Riffles,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; cautioned the aged person.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dangerous place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man stepped forth into full view. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
boys saw he was poorly dressed. His trousers
were quite ragged and his coat was torn in several
places. He wore no hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it be known,&rdquo; the old man went
on, &ldquo;but the King of Paprica holds dominion over
the Riffles. He has forbidden any one, under pain
of being fed to the sacred crocodile, from taking
the green bull frog from the pool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; whispered Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re after fish, not bull frogs,&rdquo; interposed
Frank, who seemed inclined to humor the
strange man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, in that case, don&rsquo;t forget to bait your
hooks with soft soap,&rdquo; said the old man, as he
held up a warning finger. &ldquo;Now remember, not
a word to the King of Paprica if you meet him.
He knows I&rsquo;m here on guard, so don&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo;
and with that the old man, winking at Frank
as though there was a good joke between them,
vanished amid the bushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all queer things,&rdquo; said Ned softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s daffy,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;Escaped from
some asylum, I suppose. However he looks harmless.
Come on, we don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up
with him. We&rsquo;re out for fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out more about him,&rdquo; came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from Frank. &ldquo;He winked at me as though it
was some sort of a trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the kind Ned played yesterday,&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more from yours truly,&rdquo; uttered the perpetrator
of the wrong slide. &ldquo;No more jokes for
a while. I&rsquo;m going fishing. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A HUT IN THE WOODS</h3>


<p>The boys tried to learn in which direction the
old man had gone, but he was not in sight. They
listened to hear if he was tramping through the
bushes, but there was not a sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as though he went through a hole in the
earth,&rdquo; spoke Fenn. &ldquo;But never mind. His
keepers are probably after him. He seems harmless
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes that&rsquo;s the worst kind,&rdquo; commented
Ned. &ldquo;We had better be on the lookout for him.
He might come upon us unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the boys reached the Riffles a little while
after this, and, in the excitement of hauling out a
number of fish, for the sport was good, they forgot
about the queer old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who he could have been?&rdquo; asked
Frank, after a silence of half an hour following
the landing of several chub and perch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King of Paprica.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, him. I&rsquo;d forgotten all about it. What
makes you keep thinking of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; replied Frank, so solemnly
that his chums looked at him in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there is something about that man
which will bear investigating. No one ever heard
of a crazy person being loose in these woods before,
and there&rsquo;s no lunatic asylum near by from
which he could have escaped. I tell you it looks
queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes lunatics travel hundreds of miles,&rdquo;
put in Bart. &ldquo;I read of one, once, that escaped,
and was found a good while afterward in some
place in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, did we come here to talk about odd folks
or to fish?&rdquo; asked Ned somewhat sharply. &ldquo;If
we&rsquo;re going to fish let&rsquo;s do it. All this talk will
scare &rsquo;em away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; added Fenn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
finish up and go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a date to take a walk and gather wild
flowers with some girl, Stumpy?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s as much fun as talking about a crazy
man,&rdquo; retorted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoop! I&rsquo;ve got a big one!&rdquo; ejaculated
Ned, and he pulled a wiggling beauty ashore.</p>

<p>It was the best catch so far, and the other boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
congratulated Ned on his luck. Several other
large-sized fish were pulled out after that until the
boys&rsquo; baskets were nearly full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we got plenty?&rdquo; asked Frank.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quit and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a vacancy just beneath my belt,&rdquo; and he patted
the region of his stomach in a suggestive manner.</p>

<p>Frank, who had charge of the lunch basket, into
which the boys had put what they had brought
from home, opened it. As he was handing around
the sandwiches there was a noise in the bushes behind
where the lads were seated. They started,
thinking it might be the strange man again,
but they were relieved when they saw it was Jim
Nelson, who had the reputation of being the laziest
boy in town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim,&rdquo; called Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; grunted Jim. It seemed too much of
an effort to speak. &ldquo;Bait?&rdquo; he asked, with a motion
toward his own fishing tackle which he carried
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you aren&rsquo;t the limit!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.
&ldquo;You started off fishing and depended on finding
some one to lend you the bait. Too lazy to dig it,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; responded Jim, as if that explained it
all. &ldquo;Throw over,&rdquo; he added, which the boys
construed into a request that the bait can be passed
over, since Jim had flopped down in a comfortable
attitude on the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very nerve of you makes you a delight,&rdquo;
spoke Bart as he tossed the tin can where Jim
could get it. The bait fell a little out of the lazy
lad&rsquo;s reach. Instead of getting up for it he looked
around in search of a stick with which he could
poke it toward himself. There was one near his
foot.</p>

<p>Jim reached out until he could touch the tree
branch with the toe of his shoe. Then he manipulated
the little club until he could get his fingers
on it, which took several minutes. Once it was in
his hands he managed to reach the bait can and
drew it toward him. All this while he was
stretched out on his back.</p>

<p>Still in this position he baited his hook and then,
without looking to see where it landed, he threw
the weighted line in the direction of the river.
The hook struck just on the edge of the bank on
which Jim reclined, but he could not see this and
thought it had dropped into the water. The
chums looked on at this exhibition of laziness,
though it was no new thing to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;ll catch anything, Jim?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope not, have to pull it in, and I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo;
responded the recumbent lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do it for you,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; grunted Jim, that probably being his
thanks.</p>

<p>The four comrades were munching their sandwiches,
and once in a while Jim would turn his head
and look at them. He was hungry but too lazy to
ask for something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; whispered Ned to his companions,
and then he prepared to tantalize Jim.</p>

<p>Ned took a piece of cake and tied it to a string.
The cord he fastened to the end of his fishing pole
and then, moving silently through the bushes, he
took a position directly behind Jim, and some distance
away.</p>

<p>Slowly Ned raised the pole with its dangling
string and bit of cake until the latter was poised
right over Jim&rsquo;s head. Then he slowly lowered
the dainty until it was within a few inches of Jim&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new way to feed lazy folks,&rdquo; observed Bart
in a low tone.</p>

<p>The cake was held there a few minutes, but Jim
seemed unaware of its presence. Ned could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
understand it. Then Fenn looked over and saw
that Jim was asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have the trick spoiled that way,&rdquo; murmured
Frank, and tossed a little pebble that hit
Jim on the face. The lazy boy opened his eyes,
and saw the choice bit of cake directly over his
mouth. It was coming right down to him, after
the manner in which cocoanuts, bananas and oranges
are said to drop into the hands of the happy
dwellers in tropical climes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for some fun,&rdquo; whispered Fenn.</p>

<p>The cake was almost in Jim&rsquo;s mouth. He
opened his jaws. A happy look came over his
face. He had his lips on the dainty, when, with
a quick motion, Ned jerked it away.</p>

<p>Jim was so surprised he did not know what to
do. The disgusted look on his face made the
other boys burst into a roar of laughter. Jim
raised himself on his elbow and looked at the conspirators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; he ejaculated. He was too lazy to
get mad. Then he went off in another doze.</p>

<p>Ned went back to join his companions, all of
them still laughing at the joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make him believe he&rsquo;s caught something,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn. &ldquo;Tie something to his
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; spoke Ned, and Fenn nodded
assent.</p>

<p>He made his way quietly down the bank until
he could pull Jim&rsquo;s hook from the water which
just touched it. He fastened something to it and
then gave the line a sudden yank. Jim had the
pole tied to his wrist to prevent a possible big fish
from taking it away from him as he slept, and
Fenn&rsquo;s jerk awakened him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got one,&rdquo; announced Jim, not bothering to
sit up straight. Then he began to pull in. The
line came up with a suddenness that surprised him,
as Fenn let go, and an old rubber boot, that
Stumpy had attached, flew over and struck the lazy
lad in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whopper!&rdquo; he cried until he saw what
it was. Then, with a disgusted look at the plotters
he turned over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do with a fellow like that?&rdquo;
asked Ned appealing to his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death will never overtake him,&rdquo; replied
Frank. &ldquo;It will pass him on the road, thinking
Jim has already passed in. He certainly is the
last word in laziness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four comrades decided they had enough
fishing for the day, so, putting away their tackle
and adding some fresh wet grass to the baskets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fish in order to keep them cool, they started for
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the short cut,&rdquo; suggested Frank.
&ldquo;Right through the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know it?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;I nearly
got lost once, going that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I can pick it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they began their tramp. But they had not
gone more than a mile along the half-discernable
path before Frank, who was in the lead, uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See a snake?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but here&rsquo;s a hut that I never noticed before,&rdquo;
was Frank&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I wonder if I am
on the wrong path. It looks right but I never saw
this shack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys gathered around him. On one side
of the path, in a little clearing, half hidden among
the trees, was a small log cabin. It looked as
though it had always been there, but the boys were
sure it must have been erected recently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something painted over the door,&rdquo;
said Bart.</p>

<p>The boys looked. There, in brilliant red letters,
were the words:</p>

<p class="noi blockquot"><i>KING OF PAPRICA</i></p>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well what do you think of that?&rdquo; asked
Ned. &ldquo;Talk about queer coincidences, here&rsquo;s
one! Now if only the crazy man would appear
we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one is coming,&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, as a
noise was heard near the hut.</p>

<p>The next instant a short stout man, with black
hair and a blacker moustache, came around the
corner of the hut. On his head he wore a little
gilt crown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the King of Paprica!&rdquo; whispered
Bart, but not so low as to prevent the man hearing
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; replied the man, with a bow.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the boys did not know whether
to laugh or run. It was certainly a very strange
affair, coupled with what the old man had said to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really&mdash;&rdquo; began Fenn, when the
man held up a warning hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; he said in a mild
voice. &ldquo;I am here for a certain purpose. Have
you seen an old man in these woods? Rather a
strange character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like yourself,&rdquo; said Ned, but in
the faintest whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; replied Frank, who seemed
somewhat excited over the sight of the man with
the gilt crown. &ldquo;He said you would know he
was on guard. He also&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know all about it,&rdquo; was the quick answer.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unfortunate. I beg of you not
to mention it to any one. I may rely upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said Frank so earnestly that his
chums wondered whether he knew more about the
queer happenings than they did. &ldquo;We will say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will all come out right in the end,&rdquo; went
on the man with the crown. &ldquo;Which way was
he going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed headed in this direction,&rdquo; replied
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he will arrive in time for the audience,&rdquo;
said the King of Paprica. &ldquo;I must bid you farewell
now,&rdquo; and with that he went into the hut and
closed the door after him.</p>

<p>The boys stood for a few seconds gazing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
silent cabin with it&rsquo;s odd inscription, and then
Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s get out of here. First thing
you know we&rsquo;ll be getting crazy ourselves. This
place isn&rsquo;t safe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried on through the woods and the others
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; spoke Frank.
&ldquo;The old man we met first is crazy, and this one
is his keeper. He&rsquo;s brought him out here into the
woods to cure him, and he probably has to humor
him by pretending to be a king. That&rsquo;s all there
is to it. I&rsquo;ve often read of such cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;re fond of reading about
lunatics,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. I read all I can on such cases. It is
very fascinating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; broke in Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have
something cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you have no idea what strange fancies
some of the unfortunates have,&rdquo; said Frank
earnestly. In his eyes there glowed a strange
light, and his chums, looking at him, felt he had
more than ever that queer air of mystery about
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better be moving faster than this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or we&rsquo;ll be held up again by the King of Paprica&rsquo;s
guard,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re wrong about
it, Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think both those chaps are crazy. It&rsquo;s a
puzzle to tell which one is worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
want to meet either one of them here alone in the
woods after dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Why, a lunatic
is the easiest person in the world to get along
with. All you have to do is to humor him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him kill you if he feels so disposed?&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but if you should meet one, and he asks
you to let him shoot you, fall in with his idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand him a gun, eh, Frank?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but, after he sees you are not going to
oppose him, incidentally suggest that the moon is
in the wrong quarter for a successful killing, or that
the hour has not yet arrived, or that you have nine
lives like a cat and that he had much better murder
some one who has only one life. Ten chances
to one he&rsquo;ll agree with you and let you alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that one chance would fall to me,&rdquo; observed
Fenn, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give the lunatics a wide
berth. You can have &rsquo;em all, Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve read that&rsquo;s the best way to act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your reading!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about something cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys hurried on through the woods. More
than once they got off the path and had to spend
some minutes finding it again, so they did not get
home until nearly supper time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See you Monday,&rdquo; called Frank to his chums,
as he took the road that led to his uncle&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a ball game next week, I guess,&rdquo;
came from Bart. &ldquo;You may get a chance to
play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Frank was off down the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the inside of that hut,&rdquo; observed
Ned as he and the other two boys walked on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still harping on that, eh?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;I
want to forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;d better mention anything about
the queer men we saw?&rdquo; asked Bart, as he and
Fenn strolled through the shopping district, which
was always a lively place on Saturday nights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as it&rsquo;s any of their affair. The
men are harmless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re lunatics at large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s as Frank says, one is the other&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
keeper. We&rsquo;d better mind our own affairs. Besides
Frank promised, for us, that we&rsquo;d keep
quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose we&rsquo;d better. But maybe
something will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might murder some one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, have you been reading any five-cent libraries
lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; counseled Fenn. &ldquo;Ah, good
evening,&rdquo; he added, bowing to a pretty girl who
passed them. &ldquo;Excuse me, Bart. I want to
speak to Jennie,&rdquo; and Fenn left his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way,&rdquo; growled Bart. &ldquo;A fellow&rsquo;s
no good once he gets girls on the brain,&rdquo; and he
walked on alone, and quite disgusted with Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fenn!&rdquo; exclaimed Jennie Smith, as the
boy joined her. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just like a play to see
all the lights and the people hurrying back and
forth? &lsquo;All the world&rsquo;s a stage and all the men
and women merely players.&rsquo; I think that&rsquo;s just
grand! Oh I wish I could thrill large audiences!&rdquo;
she added, for her secret desire was to
become an actress. &ldquo;What is this I see before
me! Is it a dagger, the handle&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just then Jennie collided with a fat man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
front of her. He turned, good-naturedly and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, young lady, I&rsquo;m not a dagger, though
I&rsquo;d like to get thin enough to be taken for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennie blushed, and Fenn was a little embarrassed.
Soon after that Fenn bade Jennie goodnight.</p>

<p>Monday morning when the chums reached
school there was a buzz of excitement among those
gathered on the campus waiting for the nine o&rsquo;clock
gong to ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come now,&rdquo; called some one.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Bart, as he saw the crowd
of boys hurrying toward him and his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a challenge!&rdquo; exclaimed Lem Gordon,
pitcher of the school nine, of which Bart was
catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who from?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lakeville Prep. school. It&rsquo;s for Thursday.
Dare we take &rsquo;em on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We dare do all that may become our school,&rdquo;
paraphrased Frank. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He did not
play on the regular nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re out of our class,&rdquo; said Lem.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t lost a game this year, and they&rsquo;re way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ahead of us. Have better grounds and more time
to practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t want to show the white
feather,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll have a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure will if Lem pitches as he did in the
game two weeks ago,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;That certainly
won the game for us if anything did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your catching had a lot to do with it,&rdquo; put in
Lem, &ldquo;and so did Ned&rsquo;s fielding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of Stumpy&rsquo;s work at short,&rdquo;
added Bart. &ldquo;I say let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em a game.
They can&rsquo;t any more than wallop us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; yelled the crowd of boys. &ldquo;Three
cheers for Bart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;m a political
candidate? We&rsquo;ll go in with the idea of winning!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A GREAT GAME OF BALL</h3>


<p>Word soon went around that Bart, who was
captain of the nine, had decided to accept the challenge
which had come to Harry Mathews as manager
of the team. The challenge had only arrived
that morning and there were few of the high school
boys who believed their nine stood any chance of
winning.</p>

<p>The Lakeville Preparatory School was a private
institution located about three miles from Darewell.
It was attended by youths who were fitted
for college there, and the pupils were, on the average,
older and larger than the Darewell High
School lads. Their nine had an enviable reputation
in local sporting circles.</p>

<p>The high school boys were so worked up over
the prospect of the game, with rivals they had
never yet ventured to play, that there was less attention
to lessons than usual among the members
of the nine, and their supporters, that morning.</p>

<p>Fenn must have been thinking quite seriously of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the pending contest for, when answering in the ancient
history class the question: &ldquo;Who was Cæsar&rsquo;s
greatest rival?&rdquo; he replied solemnly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lakeville Prep. School!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter in which even the
instructor had to join.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to practice for the next three
days,&rdquo; said Bart at noon recess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get
my new glove limbered up, and, Lem, you&rsquo;ll have
to think up some new curves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I need practice all right,&rdquo; responded the
pitcher. &ldquo;Suppose we have a scrub game this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>When school was over a picked nine prepared
to give battle to the regular one in order to bring
out the weak points.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to have a substitute
pitcher?&rdquo; asked Lem, as he prepared to go
into the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t afraid of breaking down, are
you?&rdquo; asked Bart anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only you never can tell what is going to
happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you go, Stumpy!&rdquo; called Bart as his
chum was tossing the ball to the right-fielder in the
warming-up practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>Fenn sent the leather spheroid toward the
catcher with all the strength of his arm. Bart
caught it on his heavy glove. As he did so he
called in a low voice to Lem, and the two held a
whispered conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he can do it?&rdquo; Lem asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we spring it on him suddenly and don&rsquo;t
give him a chance to get nervous. That&rsquo;s Stumpy&rsquo;s
main fault. But I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;ll be no need
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; responded Lem.</p>

<p>The practice game was started, and several weak
points developed in the regular high school nine.
But Bart was not discouraged. There had been
little opportunity for games, of late, and the boys
were a trifle slow. He coached them along, suggesting
improvements and offering words of advice
to some players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the captain to Frank, who made
a brilliant catch in center field. Frank was playing
on the scrub nine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a regular if you
keep on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank was not a natural baseball player. His
forte was football, but once in a while he made
brilliant plays on the nine, when he took some
other player&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of days more like this and we&rsquo;ll be
fit to give &rsquo;em all they want, to beat us,&rdquo; remarked
Bart as the boys gathered up the balls, bats and
gloves preparatory to going home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we only could beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we hold &rsquo;em to a tie I&rsquo;ll be satisfied,&rdquo; retorted
Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something no high school
nine has ever done to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the next two afternoons there was hard
practice. On one occasion Bart called on Stumpy
to take the pitcher&rsquo;s box, Lem making an excuse
that he wanted to rest his arm. Stumpy wondered
at this, as Sandy Merton was the one who usually
substituted for Lem. But this time Sandy was
left on third, his regular position.</p>

<p>Fenn had no idea he could pitch. He knew he
could send in a straight ball, and he did this in
practice. When Lem came back in the box on one
occasion after Stumpy had been filling it, he asked
in a low tone of Bart:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, but don&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning of the game the Darewell nine
assembled before school, on the campus and indulged
in some fast practice. The contest was
to take place on the Preparatory school grounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and in answer to a general petition Professor McCloud
agreed to dismiss all classes an hour earlier
that day to enable the journey to be made.</p>

<p>The nine and the substitutes went over in a big
stage but the boys and girls who were to be spectators
took trolley cars that ran close to the
grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a husky looking lot,&rdquo; observed Bart
as the stage dropped its load close to the diamond,
and he observed the other nine on the field.
&ldquo;They play fast, snappy ball, and we&rsquo;ve got our
work cut out for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Darewell team soon got into practice, their
methods being closely watched by their rivals.
Captain Benson, of the other club, greeted Bart,
and the preliminaries were soon arranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, and the game
was on.</p>

<p>The visitors had won the toss for innings, and
in consequence Lem had to open the struggle.
The first ball he pitched went wild, and the next
one struck the batter, giving him his base.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotten!&rdquo; whispered Lem to himself, disgustedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; advised Bart, walking out to
the pitcher&rsquo;s box. &ldquo;Keep cool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advice did Lem good, and he struck out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the next two men. Then they began to find his
curves and he was hit for two single baggers and
one three. At the end of the inning the game
stood three runs in favor of the Preparatory
school.</p>

<p>It was Bart&rsquo;s first turn at the bat, and he managed
to get to first on balls. Then Ned lined out
a nice two bagger, and Fenn planted one over in
right field that enabled Bart and Ned to get in.
The inning ended three to two in favor of the
home team.</p>

<p>For the next four innings neither side scored.
It was a pitchers&rsquo; battle and Lem was doing fine
work. But, on the other hand few of the Darewell
boys could find the curves of the Preparatory
school&rsquo;s pitcher.</p>

<p>The next inning the home team got in three
more runs and the visitors two, making the score
four to six, against the high school boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do better than this,&rdquo; said Bart,
as his team came to the bat for the eighth inning
which had netted the Preparatory team one run,
making their total seven.</p>

<p>The high school team seemed to &ldquo;take a brace,&rdquo;
for they made three runs by hard work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ties &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Bart excitedly, as he
came to the bat. &ldquo;Now to beat &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>As he spoke there was some sort of a commotion
near the bench where the Darewell players
were sitting. Then came a cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouch! My wrist! Let up, Sandy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the captain, running
over to where he saw a struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sandy Merton tried to play a trick on
Lem,&rdquo; explained Ned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always up to
some foolishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only showing a new wrestling hold,&rdquo;
said Sandy. &ldquo;My foot slipped and I fell on
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Lem?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrist sprained, I guess,&rdquo; and he extended
his hand which was beginning to swell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles your pitching,&rdquo; remarked Bart.
&ldquo;Pity you aren&rsquo;t left handed. Well, it&rsquo;s a good
thing we provided for an emergency. Sandy, you
ought to have better sense,&rdquo; and he spoke sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;re going to act that way about it
I&rsquo;ll not play,&rdquo; and Sandy started away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; said Bart calmly. &ldquo;Frank,
you take third in Sandy&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll pitch?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll decide when the inning&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; replied
Bart, as he went back to the bat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>Probably the little scene made Bart nervous,
for he struck out, an unusual thing with him.
That put the side out, the inning ending in the
tie score. There was little apprehension in the
ranks of the Preparatory team, but there were
anxious hearts among the high school supporters.
The cheering died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stumpy; you pitch,&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! Why I can&rsquo;t pitch! I never pitched
a regular game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m captain, and you pitch,&rdquo; said Bart decidedly,
and much amazed at his selection Stumpy
walked into the box.</p>

<p>The suddenness of it was just his salvation.
He had no chance to get nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he do it?&rdquo; asked Ned, as he started for
his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a fine, natural curve,&rdquo; replied Bart.
&ldquo;I never noticed it until the other day. Discovered
it by accident. I think he&rsquo;ll make good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Stumpy did. He hardly knew how he did
it, but he had a knack of throwing the ball that
fooled the best batters on the other team. He
struck out the first two men, and there arose murmurs
of anxiety among the rivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they put him in first?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the captain of the home team of some of his
men, wondering why so good a pitcher had been
left to the last.</p>

<p>The third batter managed to plant the leather
in a long flight in the direction of third base. But
Frank was right on the alert. He made a splendid
jump and caught it, putting the side out minus
a run. There was a wild burst of cheering from
the high school girls and boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only takes one run to beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart as his team went to the bat for the last
time. &ldquo;Somebody get it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somebody did. It was Ned, who came first to
the plate. He lined a beauty just over the center
fielder&rsquo;s head, and got two bases on it. Joe
Wright brought him in, and such a yell as went
up from the high school crowd was seldom heard
on that diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does it!&rdquo; yelled Bart, capering about.
&ldquo;Stumpy! you&rsquo;re all to the good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Ned won the game,&rdquo; objected Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your pitching held them down just when they
would have walked away from us. You&rsquo;re all to
the good, Stumpy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Stumpy!&rdquo; called some one,
and they came with a vim that made Fenn blush.</p>

<h3>ALICE HAS A CHANCE</h3>


<p>The four chums were certainly regarded as the
heroes of the school that day, for they had been
instrumental in winning a victory that went down
in the history of the institution as a most brilliant
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had it in you, Stumpy,&rdquo;
said Ned, as the nine reached the high school
grounds on the return trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;It sort of
&lsquo;growed,&rsquo; like Topsy in Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of beating the Preps,&rdquo; murmured
Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the finest thing that ever happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your wrist, Lem?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurts like the mischief. Sandy came down
on it with all his force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I wonder if he meant that?&rdquo; asked
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meant it? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well it looked queer,&rdquo; went on Fenn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
&ldquo;There we were in a tie game and we needed every
advantage we could get to hold it. Then Sandy
gets up to one of his tricks, and he might have
known something would happen. It always does
when he tries his funny work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you think he deliberately
hurt me, do you?&rdquo; asked Lem, winding his
handkerchief around the swollen wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to accuse any one unjustly,&rdquo;
Stumpy continued. &ldquo;But I heard he
was going around saying things about being done
out of his place as substitute pitcher, in practice,
by me. Maybe he thought he&rsquo;d just hurt Lem
a little so&rsquo;s he could have a chance to finish out
the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to believe it of him,&rdquo; remarked the
captain, &ldquo;but he certainly did act rather strange.
He went off angry, too. Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped.
Guess we&rsquo;d better not say anything about it unless
he tries to do something else. Come on to the
drug store, Lem, and we&rsquo;ll get some arnica for
that wrist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the boys dispersed at the school campus
where the stage had left them, but the four chums,
with Lem in their midst, walked up the street
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to tackle &rsquo;em again,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
observed Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got their measure
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll ask for a return game,&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;here comes my sister
and Jennie Smith. Look out, Stumpy, or
Jennie will be doing the Juliet act to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess not,&rdquo; spoke Fenn, and he started to
walk away, but Ned held him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t desert in the face of the enemy,&rdquo; he
said, and Fenn had to stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is some one hurt?&rdquo; cried Alice, as she
saw the cloth around Lem&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;How nice!
I mean how fortunate I happened to meet you!
Now I will have a chance to treat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to treat us to ice cream sodas?&rdquo; asked
her brother unfeelingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Bart! What is it Lem;
is your wrist broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only sprained, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me look at it,&rdquo; demanded Alice, and, regardless
of the crowd that gathered, when the five
boys and two girls formed a group on the sidewalk,
Alice proceeded to undo the handkerchief
and other cloth Lem had wound about his wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;I must look
at my book on first-aid-to-the-injured to make sure
what it is,&rdquo; and she took a little volume from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bag she carried on her arm. Rapidly turning the
pages she read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A sprain is the result of violent twisting,
stretching or partial tearing of the ligaments about
a joint, and there is often a fracture at the ends
of the bones.&rsquo; Are you sure there isn&rsquo;t a fracture,
Lem? I&rsquo;d love to treat a fracture as I never had
a chance at one yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; murmured the disabled pitcher.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was rather uneasy under the pressure Alice
brought to bear on his wrist as she turned it this
way and that, in an endeavor to see if it was
broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I hurt you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;no!&rdquo; and Lem shut
his teeth tightly together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right over to the drug store,&rdquo; spoke
Alice, as she led Lem by the injured wrist. He
tried not to show the pain she unconsciously caused
him. &ldquo;I will get some hot water and hold your
hand in it for an hour and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half an hour&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Lem said. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t got time for any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go by the book,&rdquo; Alice declared firmly.
&ldquo;A good nurse always does that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice walked into the drug store, leading Lem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as though she had done that sort of thing all her
life. The four chums followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some hot water please, in a deep basin,&rdquo; requested
Alice of the clerk, and, though the man
behind the counter looked in wonder at the strange
cavalcade, he brought out the basin full of the
steaming liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your wrist in,&rdquo; commanded Alice as she
rolled up Lem&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>

<p>He thrust his arm in, half way to the elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; replied the girl coolly, &ldquo;it
has to be. Now while we are waiting the hour
and a half let&rsquo;s talk about the game. It will help
you to forget the pain. Maybe Bart has money
for some ice cream soda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Lem, trying to get his uninjured
hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; decided Alice.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a patient. Whoever heard of a patient
standing treat?&rdquo; and she motioned to her brother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGE BOATMAN</h3>


<p>Bart went over to the soda fountain and ordered
&ldquo;something for all hands&rdquo; as he expressed
it. Meanwhile Alice remained at Lem&rsquo;s side,
holding his wrist down well under the hot water.
Lem&rsquo;s face had lost some of its pained look. The
heat was reducing the swelling and, consequently,
the pressure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly get me some cotton and bandages
ready?&rdquo; asked Alice of the clerk, and he
produced them at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you going to graduate as a trained
nurse?&rdquo; asked Bart, as he came back, a glass of
soda in each hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little boys shouldn&rsquo;t ask the nurse questions,&rdquo;
spoke Alice, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, how&rsquo;s Lem going to eat his?&rdquo; asked
Frank. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only got one hand, and it&rsquo;s hard
work dishing up the cream with a long handled
spoon if you don&rsquo;t hold the glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You boys will have to hold mine and Lem&rsquo;s,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
said Alice. &ldquo;We can eat with one hand then,&rdquo;
and so it was done. Bart held Lem&rsquo;s glass and
Fenn took charge of Alice&rsquo;s. When they finished
the boys who had acted as soda-bearers regaled
themselves on the beverage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Alice, how long before that&rsquo;ll be done?
It&rsquo;s been boiling half an hour now,&rdquo; remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More hot water, please,&rdquo; the girl requested of
the clerk. &ldquo;A little longer,&rdquo; she added to her
brother. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to bandage it and we
can go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To give her credit Alice did bandage the
sprained wrist quite well. She opened her first-aid
book on the counter in front of her and followed
a diagram showing how to fold the cloth.
The druggist complimented her on her skill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my first big case,&rdquo; said Alice with a
smile. She was very much in earnest over it, however
lightly the boys treated her ambition. &ldquo;I
hope I have some more soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope it isn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; said Lem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I hurt you,&rdquo; said Alice, looking
a little offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo; Lem hastened to
add. &ldquo;It feels ever so much better. I meant
I hope I won&rsquo;t get hurt again. The season is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
young yet and we&rsquo;ve lots of games ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to take Alice along to look
after the wounded,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be the
mascot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody was mascot to-day all right,&rdquo; came
from Bart. &ldquo;We certainly were in luck.
Stumpy, hereafter you&rsquo;re the regular substitute
pitcher. Sandy Merton can consider himself released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was dusk when the little group left the drug
store to go to their several homes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come and report to me to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Alice as she bade Lem good-bye. &ldquo;Be careful
to keep the bandage on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he promised.</p>

<p>His house was in the opposite direction to that
which the four chums took. The chums walked
on slowly together, Alice and Jennie hurrying
away to do an errand for Mrs. Keene. As the
boys turned a corner they almost collided with a
man who was walking quickly in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon!&rdquo; he muttered as he passed
through the group of lads. They were too surprised
to respond and when Bart did think to say,
&ldquo;certainly,&rdquo; the man was several feet away hurrying
up the street. The boys gazed after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who that is?&rdquo; asked Ned suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; friend of yours?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the man we met in the woods
Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, the crazy man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the one at the hut&mdash;the King of Paprica&mdash;though
he may be crazy for all I know.
I recognized him as he hurried past me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have his crown on,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his clothes were not the same,&rdquo; put in
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; insisted
Ned. &ldquo;I am sure it was the same man. I&rsquo;ll
bet there&rsquo;s some mystery here, and it&rsquo;s up to us to
solve it,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t we as good a right as any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain this man, if he is the one we saw
at the hut, is the keeper of that poor lunatic we
first met in the woods. Now what&rsquo;s the use of
bothering them. They have troubles enough,&rdquo; replied
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to get a look inside that hut,&rdquo;
went on Ned, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to, some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your curiosity may get you into trouble,&rdquo;
spoke Frank, a little seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the first time,&rdquo; and Ned laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whoever he is, he was in a great hurry,&rdquo;
said Fenn. &ldquo;Maybe the lunatic is sick and he&rsquo;s
going to get some medicine for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the man was out of sight, and, after
a little further talk the boys went on.</p>

<p>Some one must have told Sandy Merton what
Bart said about his being released from the team,
for the next day he approached the nine&rsquo;s captain
on the school campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you said I couldn&rsquo;t play on the team
any more,&rdquo; Sandy said to Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I did. Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your affair. But I tell you I
am going to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You refused to obey an order from the captain,&rdquo;
said Bart. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m better than any
of the other players, but they elected me captain and
I&rsquo;m going to run the nine or resign. You can&rsquo;t
play as long as I&rsquo;m captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how long you&rsquo;ll be captain then,&rdquo;
muttered Sandy, as he walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think he means anything?&rdquo; asked Fenn of
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether he does or not. I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sorry to have to act that way, but if the team&rsquo;s
going to amount to anything it&rsquo;s got to obey orders.
If you fellows don&rsquo;t want me for captain,
say the word and I&rsquo;ll resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resign nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to see you do it. Eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; came from the crowd that had
heard what Sandy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a row on the river after school,&rdquo;
suggested Bart to his chums during the noon recess,
and they agreed. The boys jointly owned a
well-equipped boat in which they frequently made
trips down to the lake. It was a four-oared barge,
roomy and comfortable, though not speedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we bring our fishing tackle along?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can if you like,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to. I&rsquo;m just going to take it easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite a crowd of boys went to the river after
school. Some took their swimming suits, while
others went to fish or row, as a number of them
had boats. The four chums soon got their craft
out from the house, at a public dock, where it was
kept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll row?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw lots,&rdquo; suggested Bart, and the choice
fell to Ned and Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Up or down?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Row up and float down,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to be working all the while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went up the stream for two or three miles,
and Frank, who had borrowed Ned&rsquo;s fishing
tackle, cast in. But the fish did not seem to be biting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put up a little further,&rdquo; suggested Frank.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost to the Riffles. I&rsquo;d like to get a
bite as long as I&rsquo;m at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the boat was sent round a turn of the river
the boys caught sight of another craft in which a
man was seated. His boat appeared to be anchored,
and as he stood in the bow he reached down
into the water with a long pole and seemed to be
pulling something up.</p>

<p>He did this several times, and on each occasion
would carefully examine the end of the pole which
he had stuck into the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd proceeding,&rdquo; remarked Bart, as
he looked at the lone boatman.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A PLOT AGAINST BART</h3>


<p>The man seemed to pay no attention to the approach
of the boys&rsquo; boat. He kept on dipping the
long pole into the water, shoving it down as far as
it would go, and then carefully examining the end
of it. As the chums came nearer they saw he was
conducting his investigations by means of a large
magnifying glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be small fish he&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; observed
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s the luna&mdash;&rdquo; began Fenn, as he
looked at the man, whose boat was now opposite
that of the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, and Fenn did not
finish the sentence.</p>

<p>The chums saw the man was the strange person
they had met in the woods. At the same time the
fellow looked up and seemed to recognize them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the King of Paprica?&rdquo; he
asked, as he laid down his pole and began to pull
up the rope attached to a small anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;What are you
fishing for, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly may,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I am
probing for bullets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For bullets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see the king observed some one
shooting up the river last night, and he directed
me to probe for the bullets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shooting up the river?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a boat, you know. Did you think I
meant a gun? How could one shoot up in a gun?
But don&rsquo;t mention to the king that you saw me.
He&rsquo;s not expecting to hear from me, and it might
annoy him,&rdquo; and the man allowed the boat to drift
down stream again before he brought it to anchor.
Then he began sticking the pole down into the
mud and resumed his operation of examining the
end with the magnifying glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crazy as a loon,&rdquo; remarked Frank, in a low
tone. &ldquo;Row on, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go ashore and have a look into that
hut,&rdquo; remarked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; cautioned Frank. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one,&rdquo; and he pulled in a fine
large fish.</p>

<p>He had several bites after that, and, becoming
interested in his success, Ned and Fenn rowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
further up stream where the fishing was better.
Frank caught eight fish before the boys decided to
go home. They looked for the strange man in
the boat, as they floated past where he had been,
but he was not in sight, nor was his craft to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; remarked Ned to Bart, as
they met the next Monday on the school campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your eye on Sandy Merton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed Sandy did seem to be unusually busy.
He went about from one part of the grounds to another,
talking first with one boy and then with another.
Most of them were lads with whom the
chums were not on very familiar terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess, unless it has something to do with
baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>He approached one of the boys with whom he
had seen Sandy conversing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Sandy asking you, if it&rsquo;s no secret?&rdquo;
inquired the captain of the nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a sort of secret,&rdquo; replied Fred Jenkins.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear of it soon enough though,&rdquo;
and he turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a plot,&rdquo; commented Ned with an
uneasy laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>Several other boys, whom Bart asked regarding
Sandy&rsquo;s activities, returned evasive answers.
None of the intimate friends of the chums had been
approached. Bart had no time to pursue his inquiries
further as the bell rang for school to assemble.</p>

<p>At noon, however Sandy&rsquo;s actions were explained.
On a bulletin board, used to post announcements
of athletic and other school events,
was this notice:</p>

<p class="noi blockquot">&ldquo;There will be a meeting of the Athletic
Committee this afternoon to take action
on a certain matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some of Sandy&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m ready for whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several boys crowded around the board to read
the notice. Sandy was not among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wrote it?&rdquo; inquired a number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever did was afraid to sign his name,&rdquo;
commented Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in printing, so we couldn&rsquo;t
tell whose writing it is. Well, I&rsquo;ll be at the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an expectant group that gathered in the
court which was used, after school, for sessions of
the various clubs and teams. Sandy was on hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
talking earnestly to a number of the pupils. Finally
he walked up to the big iron post where the
chairman of whatever gathering was called, usually
stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to elect a new captain of the High
School baseball nine,&rdquo; Sandy announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked several, and the four
chums looked at one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a member of the Athletic Committee,&rdquo;
went on Sandy. &ldquo;I called this meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes a majority of the committee to call a
session,&rdquo; interrupted Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, a majority did,&rdquo; responded Sandy.
&ldquo;Fred Jenkins, Peter Rand, and John Andrews,
with myself, constitute a majority. There are
only seven members. Now we&rsquo;ve decided to have
an election for a new captain,&rdquo; Sandy went on.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some objection to the present one,&rdquo; and
he looked at Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who from?&rdquo; called Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty; ain&rsquo;t there fellows?&rdquo; asked Sandy,
turning to a group of his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the rather feeble answers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I move that Lem Gordon be made captain,&rdquo;
called Fred Jenkins, evidently in furtherance of
the plot Sandy had laid to oust Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second it,&rdquo; came from Peter Rand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, and his friends
noticed he was pale. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to
me like a man, Sandy Merton, and tell me there
was opposition? I&rsquo;d have resigned in a minute.
But this is a sneaky way of doing things and I&rsquo;ll
fight it, do you understand? I&rsquo;ll resign if the
majority says I ought to but not before. Now go
ahead and hold your election!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Bart!&rdquo; called some one and there
was a loud shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order!&rdquo; vainly called Sandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want an election!&rdquo; sang out another
boy. &ldquo;Bart is the best captain we ever
had! Didn&rsquo;t we lick the Preps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; yelled a number. &ldquo;Bart for
captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them have the election!&rdquo; cried Bart.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. I know what it&rsquo;s all about.
It&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t let Sandy pitch that game.
And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I believe he deliberately
put Lem out of business so he might
have a chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a falsehood!&rdquo; cried Sandy, making a
spring toward Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Lem,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;If you want
to fight, Sandy Merton, come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way,&rdquo; counseled Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see if we can&rsquo;t settle this thing peaceably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with the election!&rdquo; called Bart, who
was getting excited. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid! I&rsquo;ll resign
if you want me to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to!&rdquo; cried a score of
voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All those in favor of Lem Gordon for captain
say &lsquo;aye,&rsquo;&rdquo; called Sandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo; shouted Lem. &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s the
captain for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; yelled a dozen voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All those who want Bart to continue captain
say so!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and the shout made the windows rattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles it. Election&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; declared
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; yelled Sandy. &ldquo;The rules
provide for ballots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is good enough for us,&rdquo; came from a
number of boys, as they crowded around Bart to
shake hands. &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s the captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a mean, sneaking plot!&rdquo; declared
Ned. &ldquo;Sandy thought he could work up enough
sentiment against Bart to get a candidate of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
own in and get back on the team. But he failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet he did!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn. &ldquo;Come
on, fellows. It&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the boys began leaving the court.
Sandy, the picture of disappointed rage, stood in
a group of his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to all who voted for me,&rdquo; called Bart,
as he made his way out past where Sandy stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you!&rdquo; growled Sandy.
&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re the Czar of the school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&mdash;&rdquo; began Bart hotly, but Ned spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to him. You&rsquo;ll only
get into trouble. It&rsquo;s all over. It was only a
trick of Sandy&rsquo;s. He hasn&rsquo;t ten friends in the
whole school.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A COW IN SCHOOL</h3>


<p>The boys thronged from the court and out on
the campus. There was a buzz of talk about what
had taken place and Sandy came in for a severe
&ldquo;raking over the coals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you mean by saying he hurt Lem
on purpose?&rdquo; asked Newton Bantry, a member
of the nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask Sandy and maybe he&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied
Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said it, and I won&rsquo;t refer
to it again. I may have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Sandy won&rsquo;t give us much chance to
ask him anything,&rdquo; said Newton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s going to leave school. I just
heard him telling some of his cronies, those who
were in the game with him. He says it&rsquo;s almost
the end of the term, and he&rsquo;s going to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s small loss,&rdquo; put in Ned. &ldquo;Though
he&rsquo;s a good ball player when he wants to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
pains. The trouble is he&rsquo;s too fond of playing
tricks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no further dissension in the nine, and
under Bart&rsquo;s leadership it won several more games.
The &ldquo;Preps.&rdquo; challenged the boys again, but,
though the high school boys did their best, they
could not win. They were beaten by one run, but
that was regarded as a great achievement against
the redoubtable nine of older lads, and almost
equivalent to a victory.</p>

<p>The weeks passed, and the end of the school
term came nearer. Examinations were the order
of the day, and the chums had little time to go off
on trips along the river save on Saturdays. They
made several excursions into the woods, and kept
a lookout for the two queer men, but did not see
them.</p>

<p>One day Ned went off alone in a search for
the hut with the strange inscription. But he
could not find it. Either he could not locate the
place where he had seen it or the cabin had been
moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get at the bottom of this,&rdquo; he murmured,
as he tramped back home. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
method in the madness of those men, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, if there was, Ned little dreamed what it
portended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s the last day of school this term,&rdquo;
remarked Fenn, one afternoon as he and his chums
strolled home. &ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;m glad of it! Those
exams., especially the algebra, nearly floored me.
Lucky there&rsquo;s no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Forget it.
We&rsquo;ll have a lot of sport to-morrow. We can cut
up a bit and the teachers won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do
something. I can feel it in my bones! Whoop!
It must be something worthy of the Darewell
Chums!&rdquo; He began to do an impromptu war
dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get us into trouble,&rdquo; came from Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble? Did I ever get you into trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Bart sarcastically. &ldquo;There
wasn&rsquo;t any trouble when you put the live frogs in
Miss Mapes&rsquo;s desk and scared her and all the other
women teachers nearly into fits. There wasn&rsquo;t any
trouble when you let a lot of mice loose in the girls&rsquo;
department. There wasn&rsquo;t any trouble when you
brought Jimmy Dodger&rsquo;s pet coon in and yelled
that it was a skunk. We didn&rsquo;t get blamed for
it all, did we? Oh, no, I guess not. Say, Ned,
if you&rsquo;re going to cut up, send in an advance
notice that it&rsquo;s your own doings and none of
ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Ned. &ldquo;If I get up
the scheme myself I&rsquo;ll take all the credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; spoke Frank. &ldquo;The
credit&mdash;and what comes after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do anything?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Witness is not prepared to answer,&rdquo; was Ned&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;I may and I may not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Ned&rsquo;s chums could have seen him an hour
later, talking to a farmer who lived about a mile
outside of the town, they would have had grave
suspicions regarding what he proposed to do to
make the last day of school memorable.</p>

<p>The morning session of the last day passed off
quietly enough. There was not much done in the
way of lessons. Some students arranged with
their teachers to do some studying during vacation
to make up &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo; and others were consulting
with the instructors about the work for next
term.</p>

<p>Professor McCloud announced that the closing
exercises would be held in the afternoon, the boys
and girls assembling in the large auditorium on the
second floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that you&rsquo;re going to make good
about that trick of yours,&rdquo; observed Fenn to Ned
at the noon recess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said I was going to play any trick?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day isn&rsquo;t over yet,&rdquo; said Ned, with a
wink.</p>

<p>At one o&rsquo;clock the boys and girls gathered in the
large hall. Ned&rsquo;s chums noticed he was not on
hand, and they looked wonderingly at each other.
There was no telling when or where Ned would
break out.</p>

<p>A program of vocal and instrumental music was
rendered and then came several recitations. It
was while Jennie Smith was in the midst of a
dramatic rendering of a poem telling of a maiden
waiting and listening for the approach of her
lover. She reached the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I feel his presence near me in the mystic midnight air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear his footsteps coming, coming up the castle stair&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At that moment there were, unmistakably, footsteps
on the stair, only they were the stairs leading
up from the court and not into a castle. Heavy
footsteps they were, not at all lover-like. Up and
up they came, sounding like several men with
heavy boots on. Jennie paused, as she stood on
the platform, and listened. The steps came
nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>An instant later the door, which was not closed
tightly, was pushed open, and into the big auditorium,
in front of the pupils ambled a gentle-eyed
cow, that, giving one astonished look around, uttered
a loud &ldquo;Moo!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>HONORING THE SENIORS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; screamed Jennie, as she made a rush
from the platform and fell in a faint just as Alice
Keene caught her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried several women teachers.</p>

<p>Professor McCloud and a number of the men instructors
dashed for the animal, but it lowered its
horns and shook its head in a way that made them
hesitate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various girls were thus crying in different parts
of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys! Let&rsquo;s get her out!&rdquo; cried
Bart as he advanced toward the cow. As he did
so Mr. Kenton, the language teacher, came down
from the platform and advanced upon the animal.
He was very near sighted and a trifle deaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked of Mr. Long.
&ldquo;Is it some visitor whom the pupils are cheering?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I would like to meet him. He seems to be a great
favorite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cow,&rdquo; Mr. Long said, beginning to laugh
as he appreciated the joke. But Mr. Kenton had
passed on unheeding and was right in front of the
animal. He imagined the exercises had been interrupted
by the entrance of some instructor from
a neighboring institution, as they frequently attended
on the closing day of the high school.
Then Mr. Kenton, peering through his glasses saw
what the intruder was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a cow!&rdquo; he exclaimed in such an accent
of strange surprise that the boys, girls and
teachers burst into a roar of laughter. This effectually
disposed of the fright, and the girls
calmed down.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile several boys had surrounded
the cow that had advanced into the room. Professor
McCloud had hurried into his office for a
long ruler. Several of the men teachers were looking
for ropes, while others were calling down
speaking tubes in frantic tones for the janitor.</p>

<p>Most of the women teachers had fled to a small
room to the right of the platform, and a number
of girls had hidden under the seats. Many of
them, however, remained standing up to see what
would happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; repeated Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lead
her out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a farmer appeared in the doorway
behind the cow. He held a rope in one hand
and a whip in the other. He seemed much surprised
at the commotion on every side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was waiting down in the yard for my cow,&rdquo;
he said, in a loud voice, &ldquo;and when I heard this
here racket I thought maybe the critter had broken
loose. Has she caused you any trouble? Hadn&rsquo;t
ought to as she&rsquo;s a very gentle, mild critter. Did
the experiment succeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Experiment? What experiment?&rdquo; inquired
Professor McCloud indignantly. &ldquo;Did you bring
this cow here, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I did, but I didn&rsquo;t lead her upstairs.
She followed a line of salt some one had sprinkled.
She&rsquo;s terrible fond of salt. All critters is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I was visited by one of your teachers yesterday&mdash;at
least he said he was a teacher&mdash;and
he paid me five dollars for the hire of my cow for
this afternoon. Said the faculty of the high school
was going to experiment on her. Make her moo
into one of them phonograph machines and then
see if cows had a language of their own. Said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it was for the benefit of the human race. So I
agreed to bring the critter here. I left her with
the teacher who met me downstairs, and then I
went off to git a drink of cider. When I come
back the cow was gone and I heard a terrible
racket. Then I see some one had sprinkled a line
of salt from that court, where I left the critter,
right up the stairs. Course I knowed then what
had happened. Is the experiment over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What teacher came to you?&rdquo; asked the principal,
trying not to smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why he gave me his card,&rdquo; and the farmer
fumbled in his pocket. &ldquo;Here it is. Mr. Bo
Vine. Don&rsquo;t he teach here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there has been a mistake,&rdquo; said
Mr. McCloud. &ldquo;We did not arrange for any experiment
on a cow. I am sorry you had this trouble
for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I got paid for it,&rdquo; replied the farmer.
&ldquo;Maybe I made a mistake in the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the principal. &ldquo;Can you induce
your bovine quadruped to accompany you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; asked the farmer, looking about
him in a puzzled manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cow,&rdquo; translated the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean this critter. Sure, yes, she&rsquo;ll
follow me. Come on, Bess,&rdquo; and he held out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
handful of salt, which the cow began to lick up
greedily. Then the farmer retreated down the
stairs, the animal slowly following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry you couldn&rsquo;t do that experiment,&rdquo; Mr.
Craft called out as he gave the cow more salt.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d liked to have heard that there phonograph
machine. You see my critter&rsquo;s real tame. She
often comes up to the back door, and once, when
she was a calf she came into the kitchen. So I
said, when that there young feller, Mr. Bo Vine,
asked if the cow could walk up a short flight of
stairs, that she could. And she done it too,&rdquo; he
added proudly. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll bid you good day,&rdquo;
and the farmer, who by this time had gotten the
animal into the lower court placed a rope about
the horns and led her away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s Ned&rsquo;s trick,&rdquo; said Bart softly to
his chums. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what he&rsquo;d be
expelled for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he gets found out,&rdquo; put in Frank.</p>

<p>It was some time before the school quieted
down. Jennie, under the ministrations of Alice,
recovered from her fainting fit, and the prospective
nurse began looking around for others whom
she might practice on. But there were no more.
The women teachers, and those girls who had hidden
under desks returned to their seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Young ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; began Professor
McCloud, &ldquo;this has been an unexpected&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he happened to think of Mr. Kenton&rsquo;s
mistake, and he had to turn aside to cover a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, under the circumstances, we will omit
the rest of the program,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I will say
nothing further about&mdash;about the cow. I think
I understand how it happened, and, in view of the
fact that it is the close of the term, we will overlook
what otherwise we could not. The seniors
will now come forward and receive their diplomas
and the exercises will be at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senior class advanced to the platform and
stood in a semi-circle about it. Ned&rsquo;s chums noticed
that he had quietly entered the assembly hall
by a rear door and taken his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky dog,&rdquo; whispered Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ned, in seeming surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just as if you didn&rsquo;t know! I always believed
you were very fond of milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cows? Was there a cow here?&rdquo; and Ned
acted as though that was the first he had heard of
it. &ldquo;I was in the laboratory getting some chemicals
for home experiments during vacation,&rdquo; he
added with a perfect look of innocence on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you were,&rdquo; and Bart smiled. &ldquo;But
never mind,&mdash;it was a peach of a joke. We&rsquo;ll
soon be out now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s serenade the seniors,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Frank, coming over to where
the two chums were. Discipline had ended for the
day, as the last of the diplomas had been presented
without formality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me. We&rsquo;ve got to honor &rsquo;em somehow.
It&rsquo;s the last we&rsquo;ll see of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the seniors, bearing their precious diplomas,
filed out, which was a signal for the rest of the
pupils to follow, the four chums, led by Ned, went
down a rear stairway. Ned took them into the
now deserted lunch room and produced several
comical false faces, some paper hats of odd design
and a number of tin fifes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some of the other fellows,&rdquo; Ned said to
Stumpy. &ldquo;We must have enough for a band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About ten other lads came, in answer to Fenn&rsquo;s
quick summons, and were soon arrayed in the
masks and caps, while their coats, turned wrong
side out, added to their fantastic appearances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; called Ned, and then, every one
playing a different tune on his fife, they marched
out on the campus.</p>

<p>The seniors, in accordance with an old custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had gathered in a circle about an ancient elm tree
and were singing. The song was &ldquo;Farewell to
Thee, Dear Alma Mater,&rdquo; and they were in the
midst of the touching lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We shall be here never more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some go to a foreign shore,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Toot! Toot!&rdquo; sounded shrilly on the fifes
and then the band of masqueraders, followed by
scores of other boys and girls, began circling the
seniors.</p>

<p>The farewell song was drowned in a burst of
weird noises, tootings, yells and shouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell to the seniors!&rdquo; called Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; echoed the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we go &rsquo;round the mulberry bush, the
mulberry bush, the mulberry bush!&rdquo; sang Bart.
&ldquo;All join hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then began a mad, merry dance. The seniors
looked on helplessly. Some of them were laughing,
and some of the girls were crying just a little
bit, at the thought of leaving all their happy comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, farewell, farewell!&rdquo; the other pupils
sang, as they ran around in a circle, hands
joined to hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give &lsquo;em &rsquo;How Can I Bear to Leave
Thee,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested Ned, and the pupils quieted
down and sang the song with feeling.</p>

<p>Then the circle broke up, and the seniors, waving
their diplomas, and trying to say good-bye to
scores at once, broke away from the old oak tree
and started home&mdash;high school pupils no longer.
But there were plenty left.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>FRANK&rsquo;S QUEER LETTER</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do this vacation?&rdquo;
asked Ned of his three chums, as they assembled
the next Monday morning at the boat dock where
they had agreed to meet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had such a strenuous time Friday I
haven&rsquo;t been able to think of anything since,&rdquo; said
Frank. &ldquo;Say that was the best last day yet,
thanks to you, Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cow was the limit,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;How
did you happen to think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it sort of came to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the cow &lsquo;sort of&rsquo; came up stairs,&rdquo; cried
Fenn. &ldquo;Say, it was as good as a circus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was easy enough once I got the farmer to
consent. I met him down in the yard and laid the
salt trail after he left. The cow did the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a swim,&rdquo; proposed Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
getting hot, and the water ought to be fine. Come
on up to the old hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The idea pleased the others. They got their
suits from the dock house where they kept them,
and soon were in their boat rowing for the swimming
hole, just below the Riffles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we&rsquo;ll see the King of Paprica?&rdquo;
said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t worry; we&rsquo;ll not bother &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Frank quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I passed the place where the hut was the
other day, and it was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may have moved it to another place because
they didn&rsquo;t want us to know where it was,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll not bother &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
said Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to tramp through the
woods to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys rowed leisurely up the stream, keeping
close in shore, where there was plenty of shade.
At one place they could send the craft along under
an arch of overhanging bushes which made a sort
of bower.</p>

<p>They had scarcely entered this spot, which was
about half a mile below the swimming hole, when
there sounded a cracking in the woods that told
them some one was walking along the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; suggested Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if
it&rsquo;s any of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>Bart and Fenn, who were rowing, rested on
their oars, and all four boys listened. The noise
came nearer. Suddenly there peered forth from
the bushes a man who had every appearance of
being a tramp.</p>

<p>His face had not felt a razor for several
weeks. His coat was in tatters, and his trousers,
into which was tucked a ragged blue shirt, were all
frayed about the bottoms, and flapped like those
on a scarecrow. His hat was a battered derby
and on one foot he wore a boot, while the other
was encased in a heavy shoe. He looked at the
boys for several seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said at length, in a pleasant voice
that contrasted strangely with his disreputable appearance.
&ldquo;Are you boys acquainted around
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; replied Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t seen a short stout man, with
a black moustache and black hair, anywhere around
here, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he have a gilt crown on?&rdquo; asked Ned
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gilt crown? No. Why should he wear
a gilt crown?&rdquo; and the tramp affected surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, I was just wondering, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
and Ned winked at the other boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t tell me what I want to
know,&rdquo; the tramp resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged
though. About how far is it to the lake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve miles from here,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I can make it by night,&rdquo; the
man said, and then he drew back into the bushes
and the boys could hear him tramping through the
woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you ask him about the gilt
crown?&rdquo; inquired Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he partly described the man we saw
at the hut that day,&rdquo; replied Ned, &ldquo;and I thought
I might as well complete it. I guess he&rsquo;s here to
add to the mystery. It&rsquo;s getting deeper. We
must certainly solve it; or try to, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a mystery out of a fish jumping
for a fly,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Let up on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! But it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, as
the boat was sent on, coming from the shady nook
into the glare of the sun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay in
all morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were soon at the swimming hole, and lost
little time in getting into the water. Its coolness
was a welcome relief from the heat and they
splashed about in great glee.</p>

<p>The boys were making such a noise, laughing
and yelling that they did not hear the hail of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
youth who came down to the edge of the bank, a
little later, and shouted at them. Finally, however,
he managed to make his presence known by a
shrill whistle in imitation of a whip-poor-will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s John Newton!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn,
recognizing the boy who had been expelled from
school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter for you, Frank,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Special delivery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the post-office of course. I&rsquo;m working
there now as messenger. Heard you boys were
here and as I had to come in this direction I
brought it along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you were going to get a job in a theater,&rdquo;
remarked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, some day, but I&rsquo;ve got to go to New
York for a good opening. There&rsquo;s none around
here for a real artist,&rdquo; and John began to warble
like a bob-o-link.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder who that letter&rsquo;s from?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better wade ashore and find out,&rdquo; suggested
Ned, and Frank did so.</p>

<p>His chums watched him take the letter from
John and sign the book and then they too, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
making their way toward shore. Frank dried
his hands on his shirt, which was on top of his pile
of clothes on the bank, and opened the envelope.</p>

<p>The letter must have been a short one, for he
was only a few seconds in reading it. As he did
so his chums could see a change come over his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; asked Bart sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;that is&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said
Frank, speaking quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to hurry back
home,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on if you don&rsquo;t mind,
and not wait for you,&rdquo; and he began to dress
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going back in the boat?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think I&rsquo;ll walk through the woods.
I&rsquo;ll take the short cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything we can do?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I wish I could tell you&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Frank replied. &ldquo;I must send an answer at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust the letter into his trousers pocket and
went on dressing himself. He completed his toilet
in a hurry and walked off through the woods,
taking the path the post-office messenger had used.
The latter had departed as soon as he delivered
the missive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a strange sort of letter Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
got,&rdquo; commented Bart as he climbed out on the
bank. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgotten
the envelope,&rdquo; and he picked it up from the ground
where Frank had dropped it.</p>

<h3>SANDY ON GUARD</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hurry after him,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too far by this time,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;Besides
I don&rsquo;t fancy going through the woods in
my bare feet. I guess it will keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s it from?&rdquo; asked Fenn. There
seemed to be nothing wrong in looking at the postmark.
Besides the chums seldom had secrets from
each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; said Bart, turning the envelope
over. &ldquo;It is from a law firm,&rdquo; he added as he
looked at the name in the upper left hand corner.
&ldquo;Wright &amp; Johnson, 11 Pine street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some relatives in New York,&rdquo; remarked
Ned. &ldquo;I am going to see &rsquo;em some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how that will throw any
light on Frank&rsquo;s queer actions,&rdquo; remarked Fenn.
&ldquo;Wonder what the trouble is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t want to tell us I don&rsquo;t see what
right we&rsquo;ve got to ask,&rdquo; came from Ned. &ldquo;Better
not say anything more to him about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him back the envelope,&rdquo; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Bart, &ldquo;and that will give him an opening if he
wants to tell us anything. If he doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;why
I guess it&rsquo;s his secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was decided to be the best move, and
the boys dressed and got into the boat. They
rowed leisurely back to the dock, speculating, at
intervals, over Frank&rsquo;s curious behavior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll go to New York,&rdquo; suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not likely to go without telling us,&rdquo; came
from Bart. &ldquo;If he does he&rsquo;ll see us before he
goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lads remained at the dock some little time,
cleaning their boat and mending a broken oar.
As they were walking up the street toward the
main part of town Ned exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes Frank now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others looked and saw their chum just
ahead of them, hurrying along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>A moment later they saw Frank enter the law
office of Judge Benton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to have quite some legal business,&rdquo;
observed Fenn. &ldquo;Maybe some one has left
him a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish some one would leave me a bit,&rdquo; observed
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>Further consideration of Frank&rsquo;s doings was
interrupted for a moment as the chums met Lem
Gordon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello Lem, where you going?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to go to the hardware store for some nails.
Lot of jobs to do around the house and dad says
I might as well keep busy during vacation. I
planned to go fishing, too, but I guess I can do
that this afternoon. Say, did you hear about
Sandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, what&rsquo;s he done now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone off camping in the woods, somewhere up
along the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one with him?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, all alone. Hired a tent that Sid Edwards
used last year and went off by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he was afraid to stay out alone
nights,&rdquo; observed Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about it,&rdquo; went on
Lem. &ldquo;Tom Jasper, who lives next door, told
me he saw a strange man talking to Sandy in the
back yard one day. The next day Sandy arranged
to go camping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a looking man was he?&rdquo; asked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I remember is that he had a very black
moustache.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>The three chums looked at one another. The
same thought was in the mind of each, that the
man might be the one who had called himself
King of Paprica.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go camping myself.&rdquo; Lem went
on. &ldquo;What you fellows going to do this vacation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t made up our minds yet,&rdquo; replied Ned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some fun, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Frank?&rdquo; inquired Lem. &ldquo;Seems
funny not to see the four of you together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be along pretty soon,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We
were up to the swimming hole, and he had some
business to attend to, so he came back ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m going after those nails,&rdquo; the pitcher
went on. &ldquo;The fence will fall down before I
get back if I don&rsquo;t hurry. It&rsquo;s been threatening
to topple for a week,&rdquo; and he went on, whistling
a merry tune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny about Sandy,&rdquo; remarked Ned,
when Lem was out of earshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And about that black-moustached man,&rdquo; went
on Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look into this. Hello,
here comes Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their chum emerged from Judge Benton&rsquo;s place
with a letter in his hand and hurried to the post-office,
nearly across the street from the lawyer&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
office. He remained inside only a few seconds,
and evidently posted the missive for, when he came
out, his hands were empty. Then he saw his
chums and hurried over toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry I had to run away,&rdquo; Frank said, with a
little bit of awkwardness in his air, &ldquo;but I had
to attend to some business in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the envelope you dropped,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;We found it when we came out to dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Frank, and, without looking
at it he put it into his pocket. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;what do you say to taking a walk after some
wild flowers this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild flowers; what for?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not for ourselves, of course,&rdquo; Frank
went on. &ldquo;I happened to meet Miss Mapes, the
teacher you know, and she asked me if I knew
where there were any. There&rsquo;s going to be an
entertainment in her church and they want some
to decorate with. I told her I thought I could
get her plenty. Do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Bart, and the others nodded assent.
Miss Mapes was a favorite with all the
pupils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet at the dock, right after dinner,&rdquo;
proposed Frank, &ldquo;row up the river a way and then
strike in through the woods. Right at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of Bender&rsquo;s Hill ought to be a good place. The
woods are thick and shady there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others agreed to this and separated, to
gather again about one o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stumpy, you and Bart row,&rdquo; suggested Ned.
&ldquo;You need the exercise to keep you from getting
fat, and Bart wants to keep in training for football
next term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like your nerve, Ned Wilding!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; came from Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; observed Ned coolly,
as he went to the stern, prepared to steer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He and I will row back,&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&mdash;take the easiest part&mdash;come
down with the current,&rdquo; growled Stumpy, but he
took his place at the oars. Perhaps he thought he
was getting too stout.</p>

<p>Bart grumbled some, but in a good-natured way,
and ended by taking his place just ahead of Fenn,
while Frank went to the bow, and soon they were
underway.</p>

<p>They tied their boat in a secluded place about
a mile above the Riffles and then struck off through
the woods. It was two miles to Bender&rsquo;s Hill, a
small mountain named after the man on whose
property it was located, and it was the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
point in the vicinity. All about it, as well as on
the sides and top of the hill, were dense woods, not
often visited.</p>

<p>After some hard tramping through underbrush
and over fallen trees, which the boys did not seem
to mind (though they would have growled if they
had been obliged to do it) they came to a little
clearing. They were about to cross it when there
came a sudden hail:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows can&rsquo;t come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know why?&rdquo; inquired Bart without
seeing who had spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m here on guard to see that no one
passes,&rdquo; and at that the boys glanced up, to see
Sandy Merton, with a little target rifle in his
hands, standing on the other edge of the clearing.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PECULIAR OPERATIONS</h3>


<p>For a few seconds the boys were too surprised
to make any answer. They saw that Sandy was
standing in front of a tent, partly hidden by the
woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; demanded
Bart. &ldquo;Are you playing soldier, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m playing fast enough,&rdquo;
spoke the former member of the baseball nine.
&ldquo;I tell you not to come across here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it one. Don&rsquo;t you fellows get
fresh with me. You think because you can run the
high school, and the nine, you can boss me but I&rsquo;ll
show you that you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one wants to boss you,&rdquo; spoke Ned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a big fool of yourself, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, eh? Well, that&rsquo;s my affair. I tell you
to keep away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; insisted Bart. &ldquo;This&mdash;well, of
course it isn&rsquo;t public property, though no one has
ever been stopped from coming here after flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s going to be stopped now,&rdquo; and
Sandy grinned as he looked at his rifle, and then
back at his tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got as much right here as you have,&rdquo;
went on Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say we have. Mr. Bender&rsquo;s no relation of
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you act so,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;standing guard
on his property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be standing guard, but I&rsquo;m not working
for Mr. Bender,&rdquo; Sandy answered. &ldquo;I tell you
that you can&rsquo;t go past, and you&rsquo;d better not try it.
I&rsquo;ve got a right for what I say, and you&rsquo;ll find out
if you try to cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you&rsquo;d shoot us?&rdquo; asked
Frank suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;You haven&rsquo;t any right here
and I order you off!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy, getting
rather tangled up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t order me off!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cross this clearing. If you point
that gun at me, Sandy Merton, I&rsquo;ll lick you so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hard you can&rsquo;t stand up for a week,&rdquo; and he started
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get rash,&rdquo; counseled Bart in a low voice.
&ldquo;No use looking for trouble. We&rsquo;ll let the mean
little cub alone. I guess there are flowers somewhere
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t any right to make us keep off,&rdquo;
complained Frank. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s got permission
from Bender to camp here and he thinks he owns
the place. I&rsquo;ll show him he doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll whip
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank again started forward, but Ned took hold
of his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Sandy might not
mean to, but the gun might go off by accident, and
it isn&rsquo;t worth the trouble. I guess we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned&rsquo;s remarks were interrupted by the sight of
a man, who suddenly appeared from the bushes
back of Sandy and stood beside the boy. His first
move was to grab the gun away from the youth and
then he called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have to ask you young gentlemen
to withdraw, but this is private property and you
are trespassing. Will you kindly go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never was any rule against going
through here before,&rdquo; said Bart in respectful tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; the man answered, &ldquo;but it is
different now. I am acting for Mr. Bender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we haven&rsquo;t any right here,&rdquo; observed
Frank, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll go if you say we must.
But it made us mad to have that little sneak Sandy
order us off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a sneak, and I&rsquo;ll punch your face for
saying so!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on over, you&rsquo;ll have all the chance you
want,&rdquo; fired back Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the man coolly. &ldquo;Perhaps
Sandy was a little hasty, but what he said was
true. He has been hired to watch this property,
but I don&rsquo;t believe he needs a gun. I did not tell
him to use one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to protect myself,&rdquo; whined Sandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Don&rsquo;t worry! You&rsquo;re too mean for us
to bother with!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; the man replied, civilly
enough. &ldquo;I have no objection to your walking all
around within a mile of here, but within that space
the land is prescribed,&rdquo; and he smiled in no unfriendly
fashion. &ldquo;I will bid you good day.
Sandy, I guess you can come with me; they will
go,&rdquo; and the man moved back into the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
whence he had come, carrying Sandy&rsquo;s rifle, and
followed by that youth, who paused to shake his fist
at the chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you ever hear the beat of that?&rdquo;
asked Ned, as he and the others turned around
and walked back. &ldquo;So this is where Sandy is
camping. I wonder what it all means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means there is something queer going on,
and I&rsquo;m going to see what it is,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll show them a trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up on top of the hill. I know a
place where we can look right down into this clearing
and all around it. It&rsquo;s from a tall tree I
climbed once when I was after bird&rsquo;s eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t see so far,&rdquo; objected Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something that we can take a peep
with,&rdquo; replied Bart, and he pulled out a small telescope.
&ldquo;I saw that advertised in a magazine and
I sent for it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It came this noon
when I was home to dinner, and I forgot to show
it to you. You can see five miles off quite plainly
through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all to the good!&rdquo; exclaimed Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What beats me,&rdquo; put in Frank, &ldquo;is how that
man came to hire Sandy, and why they&rsquo;re so afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of being seen, or of having any one on that particular
land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll find out pretty soon,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Lem said it was a man with a black
moustache who was talking to Sandy that day,&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;This fellow has a light beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might be another man, or this one might be
disguised,&rdquo; spoke Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting just like a story in a book,&rdquo; remarked
Ned. &ldquo;All it needs is the King of
Paprica now to complete it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re all in this game,&rdquo; suggested
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plot thickens, as they say on the stage,&rdquo;
remarked Frank. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll have to make
better time than this. Wonder if Miss Mapes
will get her wild flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are plenty on top of the hill,&rdquo; observed
Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard climb, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of a path around here,&rdquo;
Bart said. &ldquo;It leads to the top, and was used by
some lumbermen. I used to take it. Seems to
me&mdash;yes, here it is,&rdquo; he added as he burst through
a particularly thick patch of brush, and came out on
a rude wagon trail. &ldquo;Now it will be easier going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took about an hour to reach the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
hill, and they were so tired they sat down for a
moment to rest. They could get a good view of
the surrounding country from their vantage point,
and, for a while, tried the telescope in various directions.
As Bart had said, it was a good instrument
and showed things very clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a look at our friend Sandy&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo;
observed Bart as he went to the tree from which
he had said he could look down into the clearing.
It was his privilege to take the first peep, and when
he had climbed half way up and adjusted the
glass he focussed it on the place from which the
boys had recently been ordered away.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Bart remained motionless,
gazing at something below him. His companions
waited anxiously for some report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t appear to be anyone&mdash;hold on
though! Yes, there is. I see three men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to be walking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;No, by Jimminy! It can&rsquo;t
be possible! They&rsquo;re playing leap-frog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Playing leap-frog!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Jumping about like boys! Here, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
come up and take a look, Frank! You&rsquo;ve got
the best eyesight of any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart descended and Frank took his place. He
gazed through the telescope for several seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men are certainly jumping about,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re not playing leap-frog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hurrying from one place to another,
looking at something through big magnifying
glasses, just like that man in the boat. That&rsquo;s
who they are. I can see the King of Paprica!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Sandy there?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him. Yes, there he is. He&rsquo;s
helping them, from the look of things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In turn Ned and Fenn were allowed to gaze
through the telescope. They confirmed what
Frank had said, that the men were certainly at
some peculiar operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some more tents back of Sandy&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said Stumpy. &ldquo;And I can see a log hut, too.
There&rsquo;s something red over the door!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>NED STOPS A PANIC</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Can you read it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It begins with a &lsquo;K.&rsquo; &lsquo;King of Paprica,&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s what it is. I can see it plainly, now that the
sun is out from behind the cloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where they moved the hut to,&rdquo; Ned
went on. &ldquo;Well, this thing is getting more and
more mysterious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart again ascended the tree and took a long
observation. He reported that the men seemed to
be measuring the land with long chains, while one
was using an instrument such as surveyors carry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re planning to put a new trolley
line through,&rdquo; suggested Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably don&rsquo;t want folks to know which way
it&rsquo;s going, as if they did, they might put up the
price of land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain the queer actions of
the crazy men,&rdquo; objected Ned. &ldquo;I bet there&rsquo;s
something more than that in all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see as we can do anything,&rdquo;
spoke Frank cautiously. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any right
to go on private land. Guess we&rsquo;ll have to let
it drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder how they came to hire Sandy?&rdquo; said
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably they knew he was so unpopular he
wouldn&rsquo;t say much to the other fellows,&rdquo; explained
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow we&rsquo;ve seen what we wanted to, though
we can&rsquo;t make head or tail of it,&rdquo; came from
Fenn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on after the flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men are going away now,&rdquo; Bart reported.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone back in the woods, and
Sandy is there on guard again. He needn&rsquo;t
worry, we&rsquo;ll not bother him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys remained on top of the hill some little
while longer and then, finding a place where
there were a number of beautiful wild flowers,
gathered large bunches, wrapping the stems about
with leaves, wet in a spring, to keep the flowers
fresh.</p>

<p>They went through the woods so as to skirt
the edge of the clearing but not near enough to
it to be seen by Sandy, as they did not wish to
get into a quarrel with the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make some inquiries when we get back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to town,&rdquo; suggested Bart, &ldquo;and see if anyone has
heard of a trolley line being extended, or of any
surveyors at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom can we ask?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask Judge Benton, Frank,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;You know him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer, and Frank looked at
Bart sharply, as if to see whether the suggestion
was made with any particular motive. In fact
Bart had mentioned the lawyer&rsquo;s name to see if
Frank would volunteer anything about his visit
to the judge&rsquo;s office that day. But Frank said
nothing.</p>

<p>Rowing back was easy work, with the stream&rsquo;s
current to help the boat along, and, early that
afternoon, the boys tied up at the dock.</p>

<p>They took the flowers to the church, in the
lecture room of which the entertainment was to
be held. Miss Mapes met the boys there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very kind of you,&rdquo; she said, as she
took the blossoms. &ldquo;They will make the place
look beautifully. I hope you didn&rsquo;t have much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Frank assured her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you ought to be rewarded in some
way,&rdquo; the teacher went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do it for pay,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know that,&rdquo; responded Miss
Mapes, &ldquo;but I would like to show you how
much I appreciate it. Won&rsquo;t you come to the
entertainment to-night?&rdquo; and she held out some
tickets.</p>

<p>The boys&rsquo; faces showed how glad they would
be to come. There was to be music, singing and
tableaux, and, while the lads had money enough
to buy tickets, they were glad as are most persons
to get complimentary ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can spare them?&rdquo; asked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I am only too glad to give them to
you,&rdquo; Miss Mapes said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you boys deserve
them if any one does. All the members of
the arrangement committee get free tickets, and
I appoint you special members of the flower committee,&rdquo;
she ended, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The entertainment was much enjoyed. There
was good music and a number of popular songs
were rendered. The affair was to close with a
series of tableaux in which several young persons
were to pose as famous characters. Considerable
time and work had been put into this feature and
everyone was anxious to see it.</p>

<p>Lincoln delivering one of his speeches, Washington
reading his farewell address, and Pocahontas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
saving the life of Captain John Smith, were
given with much success. The last one was to be
a patriotic group, called the &ldquo;Spirit of &rsquo;76,&rdquo; which
is often shown in pictures, the three figures, an old
man and two younger ones, playing martial music
on drum and fife while all about them rolls the
smoke of battle.</p>

<p>To give the proper effect it was planned to
burn a quantity of red fire back of the group to
represent the mist of smoke caused by the guns,
while the explosion of cannon was to be simulated.</p>

<p>As the curtain went up on the group there was
a burst of applause when the tableaux came into
view, for it was a surprise, and not down on the
program. The red fire was touched off and a
great cloud of smoke, made lurid by the chemicals,
rolled out. Then the curtain stopped, with but
half the figures in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higher! Higher!&rdquo; called some one in the
wings of the improvised stage. &ldquo;Higher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was loud enough to be heard out in
the audience, but was intended to be audible only
to the person in charge of pulling up the curtain.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate thing that &ldquo;Higher&rdquo;
sounded so much like &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; In fact that is
what a number of persons thought the cry was,
and, taking it with the smoke, which few knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was a part of the picture, they believed some accident
had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higher! Higher!&rdquo; called the stage manager
again, not seeing the alarmed look on the
faces of the audience. He wanted the curtain
to go up, but it was caught on something.</p>

<p>Then the panic-wave, which is always ready to
sweep over a big gathering at the slightest provocation,
started. A few women screamed. Some
girls started to leave their seats and a number of
boys made ready to follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo; yelled some thoughtless one.</p>

<p>That was enough. In an instant the entire audience
had arisen and was about to make a maddened
rush for the exits, of which there were
none too many.</p>

<p>The four chums, with their girl friends, were
seated in the first row. They were near enough
to know what the matter was and to see there was
no danger. Others near them could also see, but
the vast majority was in ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they rush for the doors a lot will be
killed!&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down! Sit down!&rdquo; yelled Frank, and
Fenn joined with him in trying to calm those
around him. Several girls near them had fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be trouble!&rdquo; said Ned in
a low tone to Fenn. &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the band to play!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>Ned turned to where the orchestra had been
seated, but the players had fled. The audience
was rushing madly for the doors. They were
crushing in a terror-stricken mass around the
exits. Ned saw his opportunity and acted.</p>

<p>Grasping a cornet from the chair where the
player had dropped it he began to blow. He
had learned how to give the army bugle calls while
in camp one year, and the memory came back to
him. An instant later the sweet notes of &ldquo;Taps,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Lights out,&rdquo; sounded above the terrible noise
of the frenzied throng. The audience halted in
its mad rush.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A RIVER TRIP</h3>


<p>Standing up on his seat Ned continued to blow
the notes. Clear and true they rang out. Twice
he gave the call, but before he had begun the
second round the audience had calmed down. Ned
had saved the day; the panic was practically over.</p>

<p>Here and there a frightened woman, a hysterical
girl, or a timid man made a movement toward
getting out, but the majority had come to
a halt and turned to look at the young bugler.</p>

<p>By this time those in charge of the entertainment
were on the stage calling reassuringly to
the people. The red fire died out and the smoke
drifted away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your seats,&rdquo; said the manager, and
nearly every one did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an unfortunate mistake,&rdquo; the
manager went on. &ldquo;Luckily no one was hurt.
I regret very much that it has happened. I think
it will be best to close the entertainment. It was
almost over when the panic started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to add but that for the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
mind of this young man,&rdquo; and he looked at Ned,
who tried to hide down in his seat, &ldquo;there might
have been a terrible calamity. By his quickness
he prevented the panic from continuing. He deserves
the thanks of every one here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em, too,&rdquo; called someone.
&ldquo;Three cheers for Ned Wilding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were given with a fervor that made the
chandeliers rattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, old chap!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart,
clapping Ned on the back, while the other chums
began shaking his hands. Ned was blushing like
a girl, and was soon the center of an admiring
throng. He tried to get away but they would not
let him. Every one wanted to shake hands with
him.</p>

<p>The audience was now laughing and talking
where, but a few minutes before, it had been a
maddened, unreasoning throng; and shortly began
dispersing, and soon there remained only a few,
including those in charge of the entertainment.
Miss Mapes was among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was the luckiest thing in the world
that you boys came,&rdquo; she said to the chums.
&ldquo;What would have happened if Ned hadn&rsquo;t played
that cornet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, anyone could have done that,&rdquo; said Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
who was wishing he could get away from the
praise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they could, if they had thought of
it, but you were the only one who did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess some of the other boys would, if
I had given them the chance,&rdquo; replied the hero
of the occasion. &ldquo;I happened to be nearest the
instrument, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a great deal,&rdquo; responded the teacher.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you boys tickets to every entertainment
we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be fine,&rdquo; put in Fenn with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vote we go home,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
seem to be any more panics to put down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four chums, and the girls, left, each one
trying to outdo the other in telling of what they
thought and what they saw during the excitement.
It was as near a tragedy as had ever happened
in the town, and the next day&rsquo;s paper devoted
the whole front page to it, including a
vivid description of what Ned had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave town,&rdquo; declared Ned the
next afternoon, as he met his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why everyone I meet on the street stops me
and asks me all about it. I&rsquo;m tired of telling of
it and hearing about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not used to being a hero,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;Wait until some society sends you a medal and
you&rsquo;ll be so proud you won&rsquo;t speak to any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of leaving town makes me think it
would be a good plan,&rdquo; put in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Have you been robbing a bank or
doing something else, that you want to skip out?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but we haven&rsquo;t had any real sport since
school closed, and it&rsquo;s about time we did. I was
going to propose taking a trip up the river say
for about twenty miles, and camping out for a
week. That would be fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
with you for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count me in,&rdquo; said Bart, and Frank added
that he wasn&rsquo;t going to be left behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my plan,&rdquo; went on Fenn. &ldquo;We can
take a small shelter tent, some blankets and a camp
cook stove. The boat is big enough to carry all
that, besides us, and some things to eat. The
weather is fine now, and just right for sleeping out
of doors. We can row along slowly, stopping
where ever we want to, and tying up along shore
for the night. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;When
can we start?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow if you want to, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo;
put in Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will take a couple of days to get ready,&rdquo;
observed Fenn. &ldquo;Suppose we say Thursday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed upon, and the boys separated
to make arrangements for the trip. They owned,
jointly, a small tent that could be used for shelter
at night, and a small portable stove which they
had utilized on previous camping trips.</p>

<p>Thursday morning saw the boat loaded until
there was hardly room for the boys. The craft
was heavy but they did not mind that, and there
was no grumbling when it fell to the lot of Frank
and Ned to do the rowing for the first stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at Riverton on our way up and
hire a canoe,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;A fellow there has
a dock and keeps good boats. We&rsquo;ll want to do
a little paddling about and we can&rsquo;t, very well,
if we have all our camp stuff in this heavy craft.
We can tow the canoe behind us, and use it while
we&rsquo;re in camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others agreed that this would be a good
plan, and Bart, having taken a final look over the
boat to see that everything was in ship-shape, gave
the order to start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE TRAMP&rsquo;S HEADQUARTERS</h3>


<p>Frank and Ned began pulling with long steady
strokes. The boat with its load was not easy to
propel through the water and they knew they
could do better by taking it easy than by wasting
their strength in useless hurry.</p>

<p>Up the stream they went, past Darewell, under
the bridge spanning the stream just above the
dock, and so on beyond the outskirts of the town
until they were out into the country district surrounding
the place. It was a pleasant sunshiny
day, just warm enough to be comfortable, and
with a little breeze blowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish this could go on forever,&rdquo; spoke Fenn,
from where he was resting comfortably on the
folded tent in the bow of the craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until it comes your turn to row,&rdquo; said
Ned.</p>

<p>They reached Riverton, the next town above
Darewell about eleven o&rsquo;clock and hired the canoe,
a large green one, but very light to paddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get dinner here?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to camp let&rsquo;s camp from the
start,&rdquo; suggested Fenn. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fun of going
to a restaurant for your meals? Anyone can
do that, but it isn&rsquo;t everyone who can have theirs
in the woods as we can. Let&rsquo;s go up a few miles
more and get dinner on shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others decided this would be the most fun,
and the trip was resumed with Bart and Fenn
at the oars. They made three miles before
twelve o&rsquo;clock and then, finding a shady, level spot
near shore, tied the boat, and got out the portable
stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Stumpy,&rdquo; said Bart, who had been
elected camp manager, &ldquo;you get the wood. Ned,
you dig some worms and catch fish, and Frank
and I will get the meal ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little temporary camp was soon a busy
place. Fenn had a fire going in the stove in short
order as he found plenty of dry wood, and
Ned, going up stream, to a quiet spot, in a
little while had caught several fish. They were
soon cleaned and put on to fry with the bacon.
An appetizing odor filled the little glade in the
woods and the boys began to sniff hungrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will they be done?&rdquo; asked Frank, as
Bart bent over the pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes. You can make the coffee
if you want to. Ned, you open a can of
condensed milk and Fenn, you get out the salt
and pepper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything but the salt,&rdquo; announced Fenn a
few moments later. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the box but there&rsquo;s
none in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others looked surprised and disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jimminites: I forgot to put it in,&rdquo; he
added &ldquo;I bought all the other things but I left the
salt to the last and it slipped my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pleasant,&rdquo; observed Bart grimly.
&ldquo;How are we going to eat fresh fish without salt?
Fenn, you&rsquo;re a dandy, you are. Thinking too
much of the girls, that&rsquo;s what ails you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody might forget,&rdquo; said Stumpy in extenuation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might use gunpowder,&rdquo; put in Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
read of campers doing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; came from Bart, making a wry
face. &ldquo;Besides we haven&rsquo;t any, so that doesn&rsquo;t
count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one camping on the other side
of the river,&rdquo; said Fenn, pointing to where a little
column of smoke arose through the trees, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
opposite to where the boys were located. &ldquo;Maybe
I could borrow some salt from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Take the canoe
and paddle over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn was soon on his way. The others went
on with the preparations for dinner pending his
return, as the fish were not quite cooked. They
watched Fenn paddle over, pull his canoe upon
shore, and disappear into the woods. He was
gone a few minutes and when he reappeared a
man followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t lend any salt,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>As the boys watched they saw the man get into
the canoe with Fenn, who then paddled over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as though he wouldn&rsquo;t trust Stumpy
to bring the salt over,&rdquo; commented Bart. &ldquo;Wonder
what the man wants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a short time the canoe containing Fenn and
the stranger grounded on the little beach near
where the boys were camped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get the salt?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have the salt,&rdquo; replied the man, and
then the three boys noticed with surprise he was
the same tramp they had met the day they went
swimming, and who had inquired about the man
the boys knew as the King of Paprica.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the gentleman who was camping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the other side of the river,&rdquo; put in Fenn. &ldquo;I
asked him for some salt and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to explain,&rdquo; interrupted the tramp,
but in a polite tone. &ldquo;You see it was this way.
I am prospecting along the river, and last night
my boat, with all my camping outfit, was upset.
My food got all wet, and the only thing that
didn&rsquo;t get soaked was the box of salt. It happened
to be waterproof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was drying out my clothes and other camping
things but alas, when I came to dry out the
food I found it had spoiled. So there I was, with
nothing but salt to eat. I was just thinking of
trying for some fish when this young gentleman
came along and asked if he could borrow some
salt. I at once saw my opportunity. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;are persons with plenty to eat and no salt.
Here I am with plenty of salt but nothing to
eat. A fair exchange is no robbery.&rsquo; I at once
produced my salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I at once asked him over to dinner,&rdquo; put
in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course; glad to have you,&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;Frank, put another plate on,&rdquo; he added
waving his hand to the ground which served as a
table. &ldquo;Dinner is served,&rdquo; and he laughed, the
tramp joining him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy to meet you all,&rdquo; the ragged man went
on, not considering it necessary, it seemed, to mention
his name or ask how the boys were called.
&ldquo;There is the salt,&rdquo; and he handed over a large
box full.</p>

<p>In spite of his ragged clothes and the heavy
growth of beard on his face, the tramp&rsquo;s hands
and face were clean and he appeared to have
washed his clothes, as, though they were in tatters,
they were not dirty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to camp around here long?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied the tramp. &ldquo;I am waiting
for some friends to join me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not seem to recognize the boys as the
ones he had met in the woods recently, or, if he
did, he gave no sign of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you were prospecting,&rdquo; Ned added.
&ldquo;Not for gold, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied the ragged man with a smile.
&ldquo;The truth is I am a naturalist. I have heard
there is a certain rare kind of butterfly to be found
along this river and I am looking for it. It is
called the Oiliander Tinicander. Perhaps you
have seen it in your travels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we wouldn&rsquo;t know it if we saw it,&rdquo; remarked
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it takes years of study to recognize it.
But if you will excuse me I think I will sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crossed his legs comfortably in front of the
plate that had been placed for him, and in a few
minutes the dinner was under way. The salt certainly
added zest to the fried fish and the boys,
as well as the tramp, ate with excellent appetites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best meal I&rsquo;ve had in a long while,&rdquo; said the
ragged man. &ldquo;I hope I can return the favor
some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be happy to call on you,&rdquo; said Bart,
&ldquo;but we are going to leave this afternoon. We
are bound up the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck to you. May I trouble you
to put me on the other side?&rdquo; and he looked at
Fenn who nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that was a queer coincidence,&rdquo; spoke
Ned, as Fenn and the tramp were in the middle
of the river on the return trip. &ldquo;What in the
world is he doing around here? Looks as though
the secret hadn&rsquo;t developed yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must ask Fenn what sort of headquarters
he has over there,&rdquo; suggested Bart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll soon
be back. There I meant to ask him to sell us
some salt! He&rsquo;s taken his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can get it at the next town,&rdquo; put in
Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp just above it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A NIGHT SCARE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What sort of a place has he over there?&rdquo;
asked Bart, as Fenn came back in the canoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
he&rsquo;s camping out at all. I saw some things
in a pile on the ground, but they looked more
like a lot of instruments than anything a man
would go camping with. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t see
any boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of instruments were they?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind I never saw before. All brass or nickle
plated. Then there were some boxes. He
seemed to be drying them out, so maybe he did
have an upset of some sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s his boat now,&rdquo; called Frank, and, as
the boys watched, they saw the tramp appear from
the woods with a canoe on his shoulder.</p>

<p>The boys watched the man carefully place the
frail craft in the water. Then he went back into
the woods again and came to the shore with something
bright and shining in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the instruments,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he catches butterflies with it,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a jolly he was giving us, about being
a naturalist,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to some
game, but I don&rsquo;t see that it concerns us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s next on the program?&rdquo; asked Ned.
&ldquo;Pack up and move along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest awhile; good for the digestion,&rdquo; remarked
Bart. &ldquo;I want to see which way the
tramp goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys, lying on shore, in the shade, saw
their recent guest paddle slowly down stream.
They watched him until he disappeared around
a bend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s another link in the queer puzzle
for us to solve,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;By the way, Frank,
did you ever make any inquiries of Judge Benton
about whether there was any prospect of a new
trolley line going through?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he said he didn&rsquo;t know of any. I
told him about the men, but he said they might
be surveyors dividing the land up into building
lots. Mr. Bender is anxious to improve his
property, he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They broke camp and reached Woodport about
five o&rsquo;clock, got the salt and one or two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
things they happened to think might come in
handy, and resumed their journey up the river.
Woodport was a small place and they soon passed
it, coming to a long stretch of water that flowed
between densely wooded banks on either side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good place to camp,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;No one
to bother us. There&rsquo;s no fun camping close to
a town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you run out of salt or something
like that,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, one should get accustomed to doing
without salt, or other things he can&rsquo;t have,&rdquo;
Ned rejoined. &ldquo;I believe I could get used to
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good way to feel,&rdquo; spoke Fenn. &ldquo;I wish I
could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes strength of character,&rdquo; Ned added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get preachy,&rdquo; put in Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, instead of moralizing, you fellows had
better be looking for a place to camp,&rdquo; said Fenn,
who, with Frank, was rowing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks like a good place over there,&rdquo;
came from Bart, indicating a spot where the trees
did not seem to be so thick. &ldquo;Little beach, too,
for the boat to ground on so it won&rsquo;t pound on
the rocks if a wind comes up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>The craft was put over to it, and a closer inspection
showed the place to be well fitted for the
purpose. The rowboat was tied to an overhanging
tree and the tent was soon set up. Then a place
was made for the stove and some supplies set out.
A big tree stump served for a table and in a
little while Fenn had a good fire built.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the menu?&rdquo; he asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open a can of chicken and we&rsquo;ll fry it brown,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;That, with bread and butter
and coffee, will make a meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supper was soon on the &ldquo;stump&rdquo; and four
very hungry boys gathered around it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the milk for the coffee?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot it. It&rsquo;s in the boat,&rdquo; replied Fenn.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried down to where the craft was tied,
and a moment later his companions heard him
utter an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, did you fall in?&rdquo; called
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but the can of condensed milk did, and
it&rsquo;s the only one we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
drink coffee without milk. What&rsquo;s the matter
with you, Stumpy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. It slipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty for coffee, too,&rdquo; went on Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use it without milk,&rdquo; suggested Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. Never could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One should get accustomed to doing without
salt, or other things he can&rsquo;t have. I believe I
could get used to anything,&rsquo;&rdquo; spoke Frank
solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. He
recalled that those were the very words he had
spoken a little while before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It takes strength of character,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
Bart, still from the maxim Ned had laid down so
recently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, of course I didn&rsquo;t mean it just that
way,&rdquo; replied Ned, laughing at the trap he had
fallen into. &ldquo;I meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you meant,&rdquo; replied
Bart. &ldquo;Come now, drink your coffee black, as
the swells do when they go out to dinner. You&rsquo;ll
get used to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; replied Ned, and he
tried it, but made a wry face. However there
was no help for it, and the boys were so hungry
they didn&rsquo;t mind it much, after the first sip.</p>

<p>Supper over, the dishes and food were put
away, and, on Bart&rsquo;s suggestion, they cut a quantity
of wood to have in readiness for the camp fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll need it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any animals but foxes, rabbits and
coons in these woods. Still a fire looks cheerful,
and it may be cold toward morning. Besides, it
doesn&rsquo;t seem like camping unless you have a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it grew dark the boys looked to the fastenings
of the boats for a wind might spring up and
set them adrift. Then, starting a blaze between
two big green logs, they got their blankets ready
for bed.</p>

<p>They cut some cedar boughs which they laid
on the ground to keep off the dampness, making
several layers until Fenn, who tried it, said it was
every bit as good as his spring bed at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to stand watch?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s
going to steal us. Besides I&rsquo;m too sleepy. Let&rsquo;s
all go to bed. If any one happens to wake up
and sees the fire is low, why he can throw a log
on that will be all that&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not undress, but stretching out on the
cedar boughs pulled the blankets over them and
prepared to sleep. The fire cast a ruddy glow
on the trees and shone into the tent which was
placed near the blaze.</p>

<p>Ned, who was a light sleeper, was suddenly
awakened, some time after midnight, by hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a stick break. It sounded just back of him. He
raised his head and listened. Behind the tent
he could hear the cautious tread of some person or
some animal. He was about to awaken Bart, who
was sleeping next to him, when he saw a shadow
cast by the fire, inside the tent, on the rear wall of
the canvas. He looked out and was startled to
see a figure between the tent and the camp fire. It
appeared to be looking in on the boys. Ned
stretched out his hand and touched Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one is in the camp!&rdquo; he whispered in
his companion&rsquo;s ear, as Bart stirred.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE FARMER AND THE BULL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, suddenly
sitting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Ned. &ldquo;Some one is
prowling around!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bart&rsquo;s voice had startled the intruder. Ned
saw the figure move quickly out of the glare of
the flames, and then dart down toward the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after our boats!&rdquo; yelled Bart, who
at that moment saw the figure. &ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran from the tent followed by his three
chums. As he passed the fire Bart threw on some
light pieces of wood that blazed up quickly.</p>

<p>In the glow the figure of a man could be seen,
headed on the run for the little beach, where the
boats were tied. As he ran his coat appeared
to flap out behind him, the long tails bobbing about
from his motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that tramp!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo; yelled Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>They saw the man make a flying leap into a
canoe that was drawn up partly on shore. The
violence of the motion sent the frail craft well out
into the stream and it was caught by the current.</p>

<p>By this time the boys had reached the shore.
At first they supposed it was their canoe which the
tramp had stolen, but a second glance showed them
the green craft still in place beside the rowboat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own canoe,&rdquo; remarked Frank as the
boys watched it floating down stream. There was
no sign of the occupant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in it or did he set it adrift and start
to swim?&rdquo; inquired Fenn. All four were standing
on the edge of the water peering out over the
river in the darkness, the canoe being a deeper
blur which alone distinguished it from the surrounding
blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably lying down in it, thinking he
may get shot at,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>As if to prove his words the sound of paddling
was borne to their ears, and the canoe seemed
to move faster. The tramp had begun to propel
the craft, but they could not see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to bed,&rdquo; suggested Fenn. &ldquo;I
think we&rsquo;d better keep watch after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much use,&rdquo; came from Bart. &ldquo;That
tramp isn&rsquo;t likely to come back and there&rsquo;s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
one else around here. I vote we get what sleep
we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was decided this was as wise a thing as could
be done and after replenishing the fire, so it would
burn until morning, the campers crawled back into
the tent and slept until sunrise, no further alarms
disturbing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fellows,&rdquo; called Frank when the things
had been put away. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the program for
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll row up stream until noon,&rdquo; said Bart,
&ldquo;camp and have dinner, and, if we like the place,
stay all night. If we don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll move on to a
better one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat was soon loaded and, with the canoe
towing along behind, the trip was resumed. The
river wound in and out through a wooded country
for a few miles and then they came to a long
straight stretch where it flowed between level
fields.</p>

<p>As the boat was urged up stream under the impulse
of the oars in the hands of Bart and Fenn,
Ned, who was resting in the bow, called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steer her out a bit, Frank. There&rsquo;s a man
fishing just ahead of us and we don&rsquo;t want to disturb
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank who was at the rudder lines glanced up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and saw, about a quarter of a mile ahead, a man
standing up to his waist in water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer way to fish,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s hooked a big one and is playing
him,&rdquo; remarked Ned.</p>

<p>As they watched the man ran up out of the
water and along the bank a few feet, and then,
turning, he quickly waded out into deep water
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer proceeding,&rdquo; commented Bart,
who turned to look at the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; admitted Ned. &ldquo;He must&mdash;Why
a bull is after him!&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>As he spoke the others saw a big black bull
come tearing down the field straight toward the
river. It stopped when it came to the water&rsquo;s
edge, opposite to where the man was standing in
the stream up to his hips. There the beast
lowered its head and, with an angry snort, pawed
the soft mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Row faster!&rdquo; urged Frank. &ldquo;Maybe we
can help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the boat approached, the boys saw the man
make several other attempts to leave the river.
Each time he tried the bull would chase him back,
but the animal seemed to be afraid of getting its
feet wet, for it always stopped at the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the bull would withdraw some distance
back into the field. At such times the man
would wade along near shore until quite a
ways above or below the animal. Then he would
make a dash, hoping to fool the beast, but every
time the bull heard him and came down with a
rush.</p>

<p>The boys were now near enough to hear the
man addressing the bull in no gentle tones. The
prisoner in the water did not appear to notice the
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consarn your black hide!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Let me git out of this cold water, will ye? By
Heck! Th&rsquo; next time I try t&rsquo; put a ring in your
nose you&rsquo;ll know it. Come now, Stonewall Jackson,
let me out, will ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the bull seemed to have some grudge
against the farmer for it lowered its horns and
gave an angry bellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever I git out of here I&rsquo;ll hobble ye so&rsquo;s
ye can&rsquo;t move, ye onery black critter!&rdquo; the farmer
went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll whale ye till ye&rsquo;ll wish ye&rsquo;d behaved
yerself, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the bull had gone back up the field
and was browsing the grass. The farmer cautiously
waded down stream and made a dash for
shore. The bull heard him and came down so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
fast that its momentum carried it several feet
into the river before it could stop. Meanwhile
the farmer had hurried deeper into the stream,
splashing the water all over himself in his haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had a gun I&rsquo;d shoot ye!&rdquo; he yelled, shaking
his fist at the bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you swim to the other side?&rdquo; asked
Ned, as the boat came near.</p>

<p>The farmer looked around in surprise. He
had been so engrossed by his contest with the bull
he had not heard the craft approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look at the plight
I&rsquo;m in. No one ever gets to this pasture. I come
here to-day t&rsquo; put a ring in this critter&rsquo;s nose. He
broke away from the ropes I&rsquo;d tied him with
when I almost had it in, an&rsquo; he chased me into
th&rsquo; water. He&rsquo;s kept me here over an hour an&rsquo;
I ain&rsquo;t had my breakfast. Every time I try to
get out he charges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go away up or far down the
stream where he can&rsquo;t follow?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come down a mile from where I started,&rdquo;
the farmer said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m plumb tired out an&rsquo; I know
I&rsquo;ll catch cold stayin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; water so long. If I
ever git holt of that &rsquo;tarnation critter I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t finish, for, while he had been talking
he had been drawing near shore. The bull was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
watching him, and made another dash that sent
the farmer scurrying for deep water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he does it,&rdquo; he said to the
boys, his voice showing the despair he felt.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>FOLLOWED BY SANDY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Get into
our boat and we&rsquo;ll land you anywhere you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye?&rdquo; asked the farmer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be
th&rsquo; thing. I&rsquo;ll fool th&rsquo; savage critter. This is
where I git ahead of ye, Stonewall Jackson,&rdquo; he
added, shaking his fist again at the bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that his name?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I named him that about an hour ago,&rdquo; the
farmer said. &ldquo;He was wuss than a stone wall for
me, th&rsquo; way he kept me from gittin&rsquo; out of th&rsquo;
river. &rsquo;Fore that his name was jest plain William.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Named after any one?&rdquo; inquired Bart as the
farmer got into the rowboat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not special. Ye see I took him for a debt
a feller owed me, an&rsquo; I named him William &rsquo;cause
I took him for a bill, see? Bill bein&rsquo; short for
William.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said Bart, as he
joined in the laugh that followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got th&rsquo; best on ye now,&rdquo; the farmer went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on, looking at the beast as the boys rowed the boat
out into deeper water.</p>

<p>The bull seemed to think so, for with a loud
bellow it went back to the middle of the pasture
and began eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He fairly had me,&rdquo; the farmer said. &ldquo;He
could run along shore a good deal faster than I
could wade in th&rsquo; water, and th&rsquo; pasture runs
along th&rsquo; river for three miles, without a fence
wuth speakin&rsquo; of. I couldn&rsquo;t see no way of escapin&rsquo;.
It&rsquo;s lucky you come along. Are you
boatin&rsquo; for a livin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re taking a sort of vacation,&rdquo; replied
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had breakfast?&rdquo; inquired the farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, early this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish I had. Next time I try t&rsquo; ring a bull&rsquo;s
nose &rsquo;fore I git my meal I&rsquo;ll be a older man. I
was goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; ask ye t&rsquo; have some breakfast with me,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Garfield Johnson.
I&rsquo;ve got quite a farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;re just roughing it, and we&rsquo;re not dressed for
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Green onions! Neither be I!&rdquo; exclaimed the
farmer. &ldquo;Look at my boots, all wet and my
pants too. I wonder what Mandy&rsquo;ll say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Mandy&rsquo;s my wife,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s dreadful
particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys beached the boat in about half an
hour, and tying it fast followed Mr. Johnson to
his house, facing on a lane which led out to a
country road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in th&rsquo; back way,&rdquo; said Mr. Johnson.
&ldquo;Mandy&rsquo;s particular about her floors, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
sorter&mdash;.&rdquo; He looked down at his trousers, which
still dripped water, and laughed.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson introduced the boys to his wife,
telling her what had happened. She insisted that
the chums remain to breakfast which they did,
though they had eaten a few hours previously.
They declined an invitation to stay to dinner.
Mr. Johnson made them take a big pail of milk,
while his wife added a bag of home-made crullers
and some cheese, which formed a welcome addition
to their larder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you row up stream a mile you&rsquo;ll be right
opposite the village, or you can go by the road,&rdquo;
said the farmer as they bade him and his wife
good-bye.</p>

<p>Fenn and Bart decided they would walk, and
let Frank and Ned row the boat up and meet
them. They wanted to get some condensed milk
and matches, of which they had run out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The supplies were purchased and, in a little
while the other boys arriving took Bart and Fenn
aboard. Then the trip up the river was resumed.
They kept on until late in the afternoon, as their
double breakfast did away with the necessity for
dinner. On the way they passed a number
of steamers and barges bound for Lake Erie.
Some of them were loaded with lumber and other
commodities, while several were going up the
river empty, to get freight.</p>

<p>The boys found a fine place to camp that night
and liked it so well they remained there three days.
They had pleasant weather and thoroughly enjoyed
themselves, paddling about, fishing and going
in swimming.</p>

<p>They decided they would go no further up the
stream, and, having camped out at their last stop
for another day they packed up for the return trip.
The weather, which had been fine, seemed threatening,
and they had not brought along clothing or
blankets which would serve in case of rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it in two stages,&rdquo; said Bart, referring
to the home journey. &ldquo;One night&rsquo;s camp
will fix it so&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll not be all tired out when we
get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started early in the morning, and planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to camp just above Woodport. It was nearly
dusk when they neared the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, as the boats were
gliding along close to shore. &ldquo;Do you fellows
hear anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like some one paddling a canoe behind
us,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think. I&rsquo;ve been hearing it for
the last ten minutes,&rdquo; Ned went on. &ldquo;Some one
is following us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s that tramp,&rdquo; suggested Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; Ned remarked.
&ldquo;You and Frank row along slowly, Bart, and
I&rsquo;ll surprise whoever it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now quite dark. The noise made by
the oars drowned the sound of the paddles, if
the unknown was still following the chums.</p>

<p>Ned was busy in the stern of the boat. He
twisted a torch from papers and then soaked the
end in kerosene oil from the lantern they had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop rowing,&rdquo; he whispered to his chums,
&ldquo;but keep the oars in motion so they&rsquo;ll make a
noise as if we were still going. He&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re
are on the move and keep after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank and Bart did as Ned suggested. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could not hear the sound of the paddle but Ned
could. Suddenly there was a little glow of light
as Ned struck a match. Then there was a burst
of flame as the oil-soaked paper caught. Ned
tossed it away from the boat. It blazed up
brightly and in the glare, as it floated on the
water, the boys saw a canoe just behind them.</p>

<p>But the greatest surprise was occasioned by a
sight of the paddler. As the light gleamed on
him the chums saw he was Sandy Merton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Then the light went out, making the darkness
blacker than before.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>AT THE FAIR</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Quick! Hand me some more paper!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>Bart passed him a wad. Without stopping to
put oil on it Ned lighted the twisted torch. As
the flame grew in brightness he held it above his
head to cast a glow over the water. But there
was no canoe in sight save the one trailing behind
their own boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we found out who it was,&rdquo; remarked
Ned, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be more to find out why he was following
us,&rdquo; came from Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s camping around here,&rdquo; suggested
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is, he was quite a way from camp,&rdquo; put
in Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been hearing soft paddling behind
us for the last two miles and I determined to see
who it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he didn&rsquo;t want to be seen, by the way he
disappeared in such a hurry,&rdquo; Fenn remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep watch to-night,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Sandy or any of his friends
sneaking around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; assented Ned.</p>

<p>They lighted the lantern and, by the gleam of
it, and by that from a fire they kindled on shore,
they made their camp. A hasty meal was prepared
and then the shelter tent was put up. A
big pile of brushwood was collected for the fire
and, dividing the night into four watches, of
which Bart took the first, they spread out the
blankets and the other three prepared to sleep.</p>

<p>But the weather, which had favored them all
their trip, turned against them now. It began to
rain about ten o&rsquo;clock and from then, until morning,
there was a steady downpour.</p>

<p>However they made the best of it, though the
tent did leak, and the fire refused to do anything
more than smoulder. It was rather a cheerless
breakfast they had, for the coffee was only lukewarm
and the bacon half done. But they made
jokes about it and soon were on their way down
the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess it was too wet for Sandy,&rdquo; observed
Bart, as he tilted his hat so the rain would not drip
down his neck.</p>

<p>They left the canoe at Riverton and made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
best time possible to Darewell. Wet through, but
happy in spite of it all they reached their homes,
fully satisfied with their trip.</p>

<p>The next morning as Fenn was taking a short cut
across lots to get to Frank&rsquo;s house, he heard a noise
as though two birds were calling to one another
in a little clump of bushes. The notes came clear
and sweet and Fenn paused to catch a sight of
the songsters. As he did so something in the
bushes moved, a robin flew out and John Newton
came into view. As he did so Fenn realized that
John was one of the &ldquo;birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo; asked Fenn, who
was once more on friendly, if not intimate terms
with John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practicing that robin call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning to imitate all kinds of birds,&rdquo;
replied John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you were working as special delivery
messenger at the postoffice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was but I gave it up. Too much inside.
I want to get out where I can hear the birds. I
can imitate twenty different kinds now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can get a job on the stage some day,
and it will come in handy. I heard a fellow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a theater orchestra try to imitate a bird once, and
it wasn&rsquo;t anything as good as I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you get on the stage I&rsquo;ll come and see
you,&rdquo; said Fenn, little thinking that his promise
was some day to come true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied John, as he walked off
across the field, looking for more birds to practice
with, while Fenn went on to Frank&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>That afternoon Ned and Fenn went over to
Bart&rsquo;s house and found him cleaning a small rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting ready to go frog hunting,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;Dad likes their hind legs fried in butter and I
said I&rsquo;d get him a mess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over to Ducker&rsquo;s pond. There&rsquo;s lots of
&rsquo;em there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want any company?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, come along. Get your rifles. There&rsquo;s
a boat over there. Tell Frank and we&rsquo;ll make a
day of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They ought to be out plentiful after the rain,&rdquo;
remarked Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get some for my
father. He is fond of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys found frog-hunting great sport. As
they walked home in the twilight they passed a
field in which a crowd of men were gathered about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
numerous wagons. Here and there tents were
being raised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s the traveling fair,&rdquo; replied Ned.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, it&rsquo;s been advertised for the
last two weeks? It must have just gotten in.
Come on over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned&rsquo;s surmise proved correct. A large traveling
show and fair combined had reached Darewell,
where it was to remain for three days.
There had been a delay, caused by a break-down
of some of the wagons, and, instead of arriving
in the early morning, they had only now reached
the grounds.</p>

<p>A throng had been attracted by the show, and
scores of the boys of the town were offering their
services to help put up the tents. The burly men
in charge, however, went about their business
systematically, and, working by the glare of gasolene
torches, soon had some of the tents raised,
though the main one would not be in place until
morning.</p>

<p>In one part of the grounds the cooking wagon
with its portable ranges was in full operation, and
hungry men and women performers were making
a hasty meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take these frogs home and come back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
after supper,&rdquo; proposed Bart. &ldquo;We can have
some fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This the lads did. They found a bigger crowd
than before at the fair grounds, more wagons having
arrived with the exhibits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the way there!&rdquo; yelled a hoarse voice
as a big vehicle, drawn by four horses, approached
where the chums were standing. As they moved
out of its path they saw, painted on the side of the
wagon in large letters, that showed plainly in the
flaring torches, the word:</p>

<p class="noi blockquot">BALLOON.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, there&rsquo;s going to be a balloon ascension
every day,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
take this in to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we will,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen a balloon go up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a chance to go up in one if you
want to,&rdquo; put in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why this is a captive balloon. It&rsquo;s fast to
the ground by a rope. They let persons go up
in it for a half dollar apiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go up,&rdquo; decided Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted a ride in one.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>UP IN A BALLOON</h3>


<p>It was a good thing the fair came during the
vacation season, otherwise there would have been
slim classes in the schools of Darewell, judging by
the throng of boys and girls at the small city of
tents, the next day. It seemed that every youngster
in the county was on hand long before the
time set for the opening.</p>

<p>Many came to watch the men put the big tent
up, and the four chums were among this crowd.
There was much to interest them in the way the
canvas was handled, and to see what appeared a
tangled mass of ropes and coverings be evolved
into a big shelter, gay with flags and bunting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to watch &rsquo;em get the balloon ready,&rdquo;
said Ned, after they had seen the main tent well
under way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; chimed in Bart.</p>

<p>The big bag that was destined to sail through
the air was being prepared off to one side, and
men were laying pipes from a gas main to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it was to be filled. It was a modern affair, intended
to be inflated with illuminating vapor instead
of hot air as is sometimes the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how high up it goes?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s inquire of one of the men,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>There was such a big crowd around the laborers
that they found it almost impossible to work.
They fairly had to shove some of the boys and
other spectators out of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll have much time to answer
questions,&rdquo; ventured Fenn.</p>

<p>Just then a big man, who seemed to be in charge
of matters, called to one of the assistants, a short
chap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, Sam, bring five of those ballast bags
over here and get a move on! Don&rsquo;t go to sleep!
We haven&rsquo;t got all day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little man glanced at a pile of bags of
sand near where the boys were standing. Each bag
had a rope handle with a hook attached to it.
The little man dropped the coil of rope he had
in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring five of &rsquo;em over!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Must think I&rsquo;m Sandow. It&rsquo;s all I can do to
lift one. They weigh forty pounds a piece,&rdquo; and,
still grumbling, the little man tackled the bags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>It was evident that two, at the most, were all
he could manage. Ned, who was watching him
saw an opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; he whispered to his
chums. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him a hand and maybe
he&rsquo;ll tell us something about the balloon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An instant later the four boys hurried to the
pile of ballast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Where do you
want &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the little man evidently
somewhat surprised at the offer of help. &ldquo;Right
over there where the boss is. Say, you boys are
all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four chums each took hold of a bag. They
found them about all they wanted to carry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How high up does the balloon go?&rdquo; asked
Fenn, determined to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thousand feet,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s held
fast by a thin wire cable that goes over a drum.
You boys going up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interested in balloons; eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;Have you been
running &rsquo;em long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen years. Ain&rsquo;t much I don&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
about &rsquo;em, though I don&rsquo;t go up very often. I
won&rsquo;t do the parachute business, and they want a
man who does that now-a-days. I&rsquo;m getting too
old for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the ballast had been deposited
where the man in charge wanted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hook it into the cordage now,&rdquo; he ordered
to the little man, &ldquo;and you take charge around
here, Bill. She&rsquo;s filling now and I&rsquo;m going to
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Bill, the newly-made acquaintance
of the chums. The boys wanted to
ask him more questions, but he saved them the
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever see a balloon fill?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. How do they do it?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First we spread the bag out on the ground,&rdquo;
the little man explained. &ldquo;Then we see to the
top valve. That&rsquo;s to let the gas out when it&rsquo;s up
in the air. There&rsquo;s a cord runs from the valve
down to the basket. You pull it a little bit and
two little trap doors, worked by springs open, and
the vapor escapes from the top. Then we have
what&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;ripping cord.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s colored
red. It hangs down just as the other one does.
Only if you yank that it tears a strip out of the
balloon and lets the gas out in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens then?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come down in a hurry, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s
only used for emergency. Well, after we get the
bag laid out the way we want it, and the gas pipes
connected, we lay the cordage or net over it.
Then the balloon begins to fill. We hook on the
sand bags, all round the edge of the netting, so&rsquo;s
to keep her steady as she fills. When the gas
begins to lift the bags a bit we hook &rsquo;em on lower
down in the netting, and so on, until the balloon
is full. Then we hitch on the basket, put in the
proper amount of ballast, and it&rsquo;s all ready to go
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let it go up a thousand feet and then pull
it down by the wire cable?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. It can make a lot of trips during
a day with one filling of gas. When it begins to
collapse we put in more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it should break away?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never has happened with this outfit, though
of course it might. I had one get away once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why my assistant and myself were in it. We
didn&rsquo;t get scared, as we were old hands at the
business. We just pulled the valve cord and let
ourselves down easy. The bad part of it was it
was at the seashore and we came down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ocean. We lost the balloon but we saved our
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever have to pull the ripping cord?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once. You see that&rsquo;s to use when you want
to land in a hurry. I was up in the balloon once
and it began to descend. Gas leaked out and I
didn&rsquo;t know it. There was a strong wind and
I was being blown out across Lake Michigan that
time. It was a case of coming down quick and
hard on dry land or being blown out over the
lake. I yanked the ripping cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Fenn, as the little
man stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broke both legs,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Laid up two
months. That sort of discouraged me and I
haven&rsquo;t gone up much since. Make enough
money as a helper and I sleep better nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there much danger in a captive balloon?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly any. In fact none to speak of,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a tested wire cable.
It winds over a drum and when the drum is turned
it winds the cable up and the balloon comes down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Eh, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave me behind,&rdquo; said Bart, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the others agreed they would take a chance in
the balloon.</p>

<p>All this while the big bag had been filling. The
man and several others who were assisting, kept
hooking the ballast lower in the cordage loops
as the balloon arose in the air. It was over half
full now.</p>

<p>The boys took a look at the square basket, or
car, that was to be attached to the airship, and at
the windlass which brought the captive balloon
back to earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home and get breakfast and come
back,&rdquo; suggested Bart, as the boys had arisen early
that morning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the trip this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys returned to the grounds about nine
o&rsquo;clock. It was after ten o&rsquo;clock before the first
ascension was made. Four young men from town
went up, that being all the car would hold. The
manager cautioned them about touching the cords
and then, while the anxious throng watched and
waited, the cable began to unwind and the balloon
went up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks easy enough,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;Us for the trip next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up and up the balloon went until it looked
about the size of an apple. It remained up about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
ten minutes and then the windlass was turned by
the steam engine, which was part of the outfit, and
the airship came slowly down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like it?&rdquo; asked the manager as
the young men got out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; they exclaimed as one. &ldquo;It was
great. I could see clear to Woodport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s going to be the next?&rdquo; asked the
manager in his professional voice. &ldquo;Try a trip in
the airship! View the earth spread out like a map
beneath you, the fields mere patches of green, the
river a silver ribbon and the forest a mere bit of
fuzz like the wool on Mary&rsquo;s little lamb. Who&rsquo;s
next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are!&rdquo; cried Bart, and he and his chums
paid their money and took their places in the basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; cried the manager, and the boys,
looking over the edge of the car, saw the earth
dropping away below them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>ABOVE THE CLOUDS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; called Fenn, his
voice trembling a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter with what?&rdquo; asked Bart, whose
tones were not overly strong just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why we seem to be standing still and the earth
is going down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the way in a balloon, I&rsquo;ve read,&rdquo;
spoke Frank. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see ourselves move as
there&rsquo;s nothing to judge it by. You can&rsquo;t see
the air, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re moving through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a little more scary than I thought it
was,&rdquo; came from Ned. &ldquo;Still I guess we can
get used to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time they had been elevated five hundred
feet they were accustomed to the strange and
peculiar sensation. They were no longer frightened,
and when they had gone up as far as the
cable would let them they were almost wishing the
journey was twice as long. As the manager had
said, the country was spread out under them like
a big relief map. They could recognize some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
buildings in town, and also pick out other hamlets
surrounding Darewell. Bart even declared
he could see the clearing where Sandy had stood
on guard, and where the men had been observed
acting so strangely that day, but the others were
not able to make it out.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes the balloon was hauled
down. The boys climbed from the basket, trying
to answer the scores of questions that were asked
of them by persons in the crowd. After that
many made trips in the captive airship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was great,&rdquo; declared Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish it had gotten loose,&rdquo; said Ned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take a long trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it again to-morrow,&rdquo; said Bart,
&ldquo;only don&rsquo;t you go wishing it would break loose,
Ned. It might happen, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wire cable couldn&rsquo;t break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I don&rsquo;t want it to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long while the boys remained to watch
the balloon go up and down with the scores who
ventured in it. Then, as there were many other
things to see at the fair, they made a tour of the
grounds.</p>

<p>They were on hand the next day, and made another
trip in the balloon. This time it was a little
foggy and they could not see so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Half price to-morrow boys,&rdquo; remarked the
manager, as they came down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take it in,&rdquo; declared Fenn.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t miss a bargain like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So great an attraction did the reduced rate prove
that it was afternoon of the last day of the fair
before the four chums had a chance to go up in
the balloon again. Once more they got into the
big basket. The captive airship had been freshly
filled with gas and was pulling and tugging at the
restraining cable as though it wanted to be free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; called the manager, and for the
third time the boys saw the earth dropping away
beneath them. They could not get over that first
queer sinking feeling in the stomach as the balloon
first started skyward, but, after it had gone up a
few hundred feet they were used to it.</p>

<p>The day was a wonderfully clear one, and the
boys could see for miles in every direction. Off to
the northwest Lake Erie sparkled in the sunlight,
and the Still river looked like a band of silver laid
between green banks and through dark green forests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;I wish we
could stay up all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going down,&rdquo; remarked Ned, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
there came a tug at the bottom of the basket where
the cable was fastened.</p>

<p>The balloon gave a little jerk and swayed from
side to side. The boys clutched the edge of the
basket and looked over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something has happened!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>They could see the crowd running to and fro
and a number of men signaling to them with their
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could have happened?&rdquo; asked Frank.
&ldquo;Is the balloon on fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s broken loose!&rdquo; yelled Fenn.
&ldquo;See! The cable is dangling below us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning over as far as they dared, the others
saw that the wire rope had become loosened from
the drum and was swaying about in the air. It
had become unfastened when the machinery began
to revolve to haul the balloon down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re loose! We&rsquo;re going up!&rdquo; almost
screamed Fenn.</p>

<p>Down below them the earth once more was dropping
away at a fearful rate. The freshly-filled
balloon was shooting skyward faster than ever before,
since there was no restraining cable to hold
it back.</p>

<p>The terror of their position held the boys dumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for a while. They gazed at each other with
horror in their eyes. Their cheeks were pale, and
their hearts were beating violently.</p>

<p>Being taken so suddenly into the lighter atmosphere
of the upper regions almost deprived them
of their senses. They could hardly breathe,
partly because of natural causes and partly because
of the terrible fright that gripped them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;got&mdash;your&mdash;wish, Ned,&rdquo;
spoke Bart with some difficulty, looking at his
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;guess&mdash;I&mdash;did,&rdquo; replied Ned
slowly.</p>

<p>Their voices seemed to dispel the strain they
were all under. They had been fearful of moving
since the balloon broke away, thinking they might
fall from the terrible height. But now Bart sat
down in the bottom of the basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we might be worse off,&rdquo; spoke Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might be falling down instead of up.
We&rsquo;re in no danger for a while anyhow. There&rsquo;s
no wind to speak of. We&rsquo;re going straight up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far I wonder?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we can stop when we want to,&rdquo; said
Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By pulling the valve cord, of course. Don&rsquo;t
you know what the man told us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Well then, let&rsquo;s pull it. This
is high enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all stood up and began looking for the
valve and ripping cords. The man had told them
they were connected with the basket, but on previous
trips they had not thought to search them
out amid the mass of cordage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s brown and the other&rsquo;s red,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any,&rdquo; said Fenn, after a long gaze
aloft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I either,&rdquo; admitted Bart, and the others had
to confess they saw nothing of the cords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they forgot to arrange them for this
trip,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice pickle for us if they did,&rdquo; observed Bart.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sail on forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though the boys made light of their plight,
it was not a pleasant one. The balloon with its
fresh supply of gas was good for many miles&rsquo;
travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;re going up or standing still?&rdquo;
asked Fenn. He looked over the edge of the basket.
The ground below was a mere blur, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which the only difference in color between the
woods and the fields could be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can soon tell,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket some paper and began
tearing it into little pieces. When he had a handful
he tossed them over the side of the basket.
They seemed pulled down by some unseen force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up,&rdquo; announced Bart in a strange
voice. &ldquo;Those papers practically stood still. It
was us shooting past them that made it look as
though they fell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far up are we I wonder?&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>A moment later a damp mist appeared to settle
down over the balloon. So dense was it that they
could no longer make out the big bag over their
heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re above the clouds,&rdquo; came from Bart in
solemn tones.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>INTO THE RIVER</h3>


<p>For a moment the announcement struck such a
chill of terror to the hearts of the boys that they
did not know what to say. The thought of being
more than a mile above the earth was fearful to the
lads who had never been even on a high mountain.
Now they were far up in the air, with only the frail
willow basket, and the lifting power of the gas
in the silken bag, between them and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a fog from the river. Perhaps
we&rsquo;ve dropped down,&rdquo; said Fenn, anxious to derive
some consolation from their perilous position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t come down a foot,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;Might as well admit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tossed some more pieces of the torn paper
over the side. This time they remained stationary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate we&rsquo;ve stopped going up,&rdquo; he
called out. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re standing still!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companions watched the scraps of paper
anxiously. Slowly they began to settle toward the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves it,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re standing
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lot of good it will do us,&rdquo; came from Ned.
&ldquo;How long will we have to stay here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard to say,&rdquo; Bart replied. &ldquo;But you
wanted this to happen so you ought to be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known it was like this I&rsquo;d never wished
for it even in fun,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
s&rsquo;pose we can get down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; sometime. The gas can&rsquo;t stay in the
bag forever. Some is bound to leak out and we&rsquo;ll
descend. Besides, as it gets colder we&rsquo;ll drop
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the man told me the cold sort of condenses
the gas. Makes it so there isn&rsquo;t so much of
it, and it hasn&rsquo;t the same lifting power. But
there&rsquo;s one disadvantage to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why as soon as it gets warm again, when the
sun comes out, it expands the gas and we&rsquo;ll rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on going back and forth, eh?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; suggested Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Stumpy?&rdquo; inquired his chums eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I could cut a hole in the bag with my knife
and let some of the gas out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you reach the bag? The lowest
end of it, the neck, where the gas went in, is ten
feet over our heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could climb up the cordage. I read of a
fellow doing that once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too risky,&rdquo; decided Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; declared Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait a while,&rdquo; Bart decided. &ldquo;We
may come down without doing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there did not seem much chance of it. The
big balloon was still in the midst of the clouds.
Which way they were going the boys had no means
of knowing. They could see nothing but the mass
of gray vapor, which, now and then, swirled aside
long enough to disclose the black bag above their
heads.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was great excitement on the
fair grounds. The crowd ran to and fro vainly
seeking some means of bringing the balloon down.
Word was quickly sent to the boys&rsquo; parents and relatives,
and they came hurrying to the place, well
nigh distracted. By this time the airship was a mere
speck in the heavens. A little later it disappeared
above the clouds.</p>

<p>There were some threats of arresting the manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the enterprise, but wiser counsel prevailed.
It was shown that the accident was unavoidable.
The catch that fastened the wire cable to the drum
had become loosened by the many ascensions and
let the rope slip away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; the manager declared,
but he had hard work to make any one believe him.
Indeed his own drawn face showed he was alarmed
for the safety of the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bright lads,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;One of
my helpers was explaining to them the other day
about the valve cords. They will pull them and
the balloon will come down. It may sail a few
miles from here, but they&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose they pull the wrong cord?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Wilding who with Bart&rsquo;s and Fenn&rsquo;s parents,
and Frank&rsquo;s uncle had gathered about the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the owner of
the balloon. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too smart for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no good in worrying,&rdquo; decided
Mr. Keene. &ldquo;Maybe the boys can take care of
themselves, but they&rsquo;re in a ticklish place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words served to comfort the others somewhat,
though Mrs. Keene and Mrs. Masterson
could not stop crying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was nothing the boys could do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
They could only wait for something to happen.
And that something was for the gas to leave the
bag gradually so they could descend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Bart, looking
at his watch. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re good for all
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be cold,&rdquo; said Ned, with a shiver.</p>

<p>Already the mist was beginning to tell on the
boys. Their clothes were covered with the fine
fog which clung to them like frost. They knew it
would be quite chilly before morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not a thing to eat,&rdquo; said Bart with a
sigh. &ldquo;The next time I come ballooning I&rsquo;m going
to bring a sandwich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time I come ballooning I&rsquo;ll be a great
deal older than I am now,&rdquo; came from Frank.
&ldquo;No more for yours truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Fenn, &ldquo;is what
become of those cords. They must be on the balloon.
I saw them the first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we take another look,&rdquo; suggested
Ned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy staying here all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em I&rsquo;m going to climb up
and poke a hole in the bag,&rdquo; declared Stumpy.</p>

<p>The boys took their positions one on each side
of the big basket and began staring aloft, through
the mist, for a sight of the cords. There was such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a maze of ropes and netting that it was hard to
distinguish anything. The mist too, bothered
them.</p>

<p>There came a little puff of wind which made the
big balloon sway so that the boys clutched the sides
of the willow car. There was a peculiar sensation
as though the bottom of their stomachs had
dropped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going down!&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p>The mist seemed to break away. The bag
could be plainly seen. Hurriedly Bart tore up
some more scraps of paper and tossed them over.
They remained stationary an instant and then began
to settle earthward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;False alarm,&rdquo; said Bart with despair in his
voice.</p>

<p>But they had gone down a few feet, or else
the mist had lifted, for they were no longer in the
cloud. They could see nothing of the earth, however.</p>

<p>All at once Fenn who had resumed his upward-gazing
gave a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Stumpy?&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cords! The cords! I see them!&rdquo; the
boy exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and they all came around to his
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There, right near where the mouth of the bag
is fastened to the cordage. Don&rsquo;t you see
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough! There they are!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart.</p>

<p>Then the others beheld the brown and red cords
that connected, one with the valve in the top, and
the other with the strip, to be ripped out, in case
of emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t reach &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
ten feet up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was so. The ends of the cords had, in
some way, been caught in the netting and were
held at least ten feet above the edge of the basket.
To reach them meant a dizzy and dangerous
climb.</p>

<p>Stumpy looked first from one side of the basket
and then from the other, at the cords that
meant so much to them. He took off his coat and
vest and began removing his shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get those cords down where we
can reach &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Fenn shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How? You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You watch me! Didn&rsquo;t I take the prize at
school for high trapeze work?&rdquo; and Stumpy went
on unlacing his shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to climb up in that cordage?&rdquo;
demanded Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way!&rdquo; said Fenn earnestly.
&ldquo;We may be killed if I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no danger
boys. I&rsquo;ll climb from the inside. If I fall,
I&rsquo;ll only fall into the basket! I&rsquo;m going up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the others could stop him he had
reached up and taken a firm hold of the cords just
above the edge of the basket. They were very
strong, and there were so many of them that they
would have held a much greater weight than that
of Fenn.</p>

<p>But it was a ticklish thing to climb up the netting
of a balloon, more than half a mile above the
earth. True, he was right over the basket, and if
he slipped would land into it. But it was a daring
thing to do, and his chums held their breaths as
they watched him.</p>

<p>Up and up Stumpy went. His stockinged feet
gave him a good purchase on the netting, and,
clinging with his hands in a desperate grip, he
mounted higher and higher toward where the
caught cords dangled. It was only about ten feet
but to Stumpy and his chums it seemed like a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>Now he was but three feet away from the cords.
Cautiously he kept on. The balloon swayed with
the unusual weight on one side and the basket
tilted.</p>

<p>For a moment Fenn hesitated. He was getting
dizzy. Then he gritted his teeth and went
on. Steadying himself as best he could, in the insecure
and waving netting, he reached out one
hand and managed to grasp the red cord. He
loosened it and it fell so that it hung within reach
of his comrades. Then he released the brown one
and it, too, fell free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; called Ned, and Stumpy, his
dangerous task accomplished, began to descend.
He was trembling like a leaf when he crouched
down in the basket again. His chums, each in
turn, silently pressed his hand. They could not
speak for a few moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for home!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart as he
grasped the brown cord. &ldquo;Lie down in the bottom
of the basket, all of you. No telling what
will happen when the gas begins to go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled the cord slightly. There was a sudden
lurch to the balloon and again came that
strange feeling as if the bottom of their stomachs
were dropping out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going down!&rdquo; cried Frank joyfully.</p>

<p>It was so. The gas escaped through the valve
as Bart pulled the cord, and the big airship, its
journey almost ended, was nearing the earth.</p>

<p>As the valves would only stay open when the
cord was taut, springing shut when it was slack,
Bart kept giving it little jerks, regulating them according
to the sensation of falling. He did not
want the balloon to come down too swiftly.</p>

<p>It was now dusk, and, as they looked over the
side of the basket they could dimly distinguish the
earth coming up to meet them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you see where we are?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too dark,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>He opened the valve wider. The balloon shot
downward with a sickening swiftness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; called Frank.</p>

<p>He got up to look over the edge. As he did so
he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re near the river!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Bart let out more gas, hoping to land the balloon
before the water was reached, but he miscalculated.
An instant later the airship, with the big bag almost
collapsed, came down with a rush and the
willow basket struck the water with a great
splash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump out and swim for it!&rdquo; yelled Bart.
&ldquo;The balloon will smother you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dived over the side of the basket. His companions
followed him. There was a sickening
smell of gas in the air.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>CAPTURED</h3>


<p>Hampered by their shoes and clothing the boys
could not make much headway in the water. Fenn,
who was not a very good swimmer, was the last to
strike out. Bart caught a glimpse of him, and saw
the bag settling down over his chum.</p>

<p>He turned and grabbed Fenn by the shoulder,
pulling him out of the way just as the silken folds
settled down on top of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What has happened?&rdquo;
cried a voice through the darkness, and the boys
saw lights from a boat flashing in their faces.
Then they noticed a big barge looming up, and
struck out for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw us a line!&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>Aboard the boat men were running to and fro
and calling to one another. More lights flashed
out and several figures appeared at the sides.
Then ropes splashed into the water.</p>

<p>Bart and Fenn each grabbed one and began to
pull themselves aboard. Ned and Frank were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the other side of the barge. There also, men had
cast cables into the river and their splash told the
swimming boys there was help at hand. They
grabbed the lines, and soon all four were standing
on the deck of the craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where did you all come from?&rdquo; asked
a hearty voice and a big man, his face almost concealed
by a beard, that covered everything except
his eyes, strode forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the balloon,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what that big thing was that flopped
down here, eh?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;Well, you had
quite a time of it. Who are you, anyhow, airship
men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned told their names, and related how the balloon
had broken away, taking them with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s valuable,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Maybe if
you took it aboard you could get a reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something else to do besides saving
balloons,&rdquo; the bearded man replied. &ldquo;Delayed
our trip as it was, pulling you chaps from the
water, but I don&rsquo;t mind that. Let &rsquo;em send for
their old gas bag if they want it. Guess it won&rsquo;t
run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the captain of this boat?&rdquo; asked
Bart, taking off his coat and wringing some of the
water out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am, Captain Needham, of the
steam barge <i>Comet</i>. At present under sealed orders,&rdquo;
and he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Still river, just above Dunkirk,&rdquo; replied
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far is that from Darewell?&rdquo; inquired
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you from Darewell?&rdquo; asked Captain
Needham quickly, and he looked sharply at the
boys who stood in a circle of light cast by several
lanterns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s where we live,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re about fifty miles from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; asked Frank, as
the barge was anchored then, and the boys had
not had time to notice in which direction she was
headed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I guess we&rsquo;d better go ashore,&rdquo; remarked
Ned. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get any further
away from home. We must send word to our
folks that we&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; spoke the captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to
be a little difficult though. There&rsquo;s no telephone
in Dunkirk, and you&rsquo;ll have to tramp five miles to
send a message. You&rsquo;d better stay aboard until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
we get to Flanders, that&rsquo;s the next town above.
We&rsquo;ll be there by morning, and you can wire from
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go ashore now and take
our chances at getting a message through to-night,&rdquo;
Frank said. &ldquo;Maybe we can hire a carriage in
Dunkirk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, I hate to interfere with your
plans,&rdquo; the captain said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m behindhand
now, and I can&rsquo;t stop to put you ashore. You&rsquo;ll
have to wait until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us could swim ashore and send a message,&rdquo;
put in Ned. &ldquo;We really ought to send
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go below to the engine room and get
dried out first,&rdquo; the captain advised. &ldquo;The river
is full of rocks here and it&rsquo;s a bad place to swim.
The banks are a mass of muck, like quick-sand,
dangerous to venture into. You get your clothes
off and we&rsquo;ll soon have &rsquo;em dry. By that time
we&rsquo;ll be in a better place for swimming. Besides
you must be hungry. We&rsquo;re under way
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a throbbing to the barge
that told the boys the engine had been started.
The anchor was hauled up and the boat again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
started up the river. It was too dark to see more
than the dim outline of the big gas bag as it rested
partly on shore and partly in the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess drying-out wouldn&rsquo;t hurt us,&rdquo;
Frank said. &ldquo;But after that we must get word to
the folks if we have to walk ten miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;Now
come on with me and I&rsquo;ll fix you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way to the engine room, and turned
the boys over to one of the deck hands. The
latter collected from the men some old garments
the boys could don while their own were drying.
Their change consisted of nothing but a jumper
and a pair of overalls each, but it was warm in
the engine room and they did not mind. Their
soaking clothing and shoes were soon in the process
of steaming dry on hot pipes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Frank.
&ldquo;We certainly did have a strenuous time of it
for a while though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder where this barge is going to?&rdquo; said
Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bigger one than I ever saw on the
river before. It&rsquo;s got a lot of machinery aboard,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t interest me so much as the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of when they have supper,&rdquo; came from Bart.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting warm and dry and I begin to feel my
appetite coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were close to the big boiler where it was
warm enough to almost bake bread. As they were
huddled there, getting the river chill out of them,
they heard somebody approaching down the passage
that led to the engine room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope it&rsquo;s someone to say supper is ready,&rdquo;
spoke Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Needham says you are to&mdash;&rdquo; a voice
began and then it suddenly stopped. The chums
looked up and saw, in the glare from a lantern, a
youth staring at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandy Merton!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>At this the other boys pressed forward to get a
look at the lad who had acted so strangely of
late. But Sandy did not give them a chance. He
turned and fairly ran from the engine room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well of all the odd places we come across
that chap this is the queerest,&rdquo; spoke Ned.
&ldquo;What in the world can he be doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was going to ask,&rdquo; Bart said.
&ldquo;It looks funny. We must ask Captain Needham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, boys, getting warmed through?&rdquo; asked
a voice, and Captain Needham appeared a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
later. &ldquo;Well, you look pretty comfortable.
Guess you&rsquo;re ready for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good guesser, sir,&rdquo; said Fenn with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right this way then,&rdquo; the captain went on
quickly, opening a small door which led from the
engine room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have something sent in here.
There&rsquo;s a table and some chairs. It&rsquo;s warm and
you can dress in there when your clothes are dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys went into the apartment he indicated.
It was lighted by a small hanging lamp. They
sat down to the table, presenting a queer sight in
the overalls and jumpers several sizes too large for
them. In a little while a man came in with a big
tray on which were plates of beef-stew, cups of
coffee and plenty of bread and butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sort of a pick-up meal,&rdquo; Captain Needham
said, as he looked in on them a little later, when
they were in the midst of it. &ldquo;Best we could do in
a hurry. We don&rsquo;t often have people drop in on
us out of a balloon for supper,&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, captain,&rdquo; began Ned. &ldquo;Is that boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a little while,&rdquo; called the captain,
as he closed the door, leaving the chums
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask him about Sandy,&rdquo; added
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll keep,&rdquo; remarked Bart.</p>

<p>The boys finished their meal and felt better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get into my clothes,&rdquo; remarked
Fenn. &ldquo;I want to see about sending a message
home. We must be out of the dangerous part
of the river now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the door and we&rsquo;ll go back to the engine
room and see if they aren&rsquo;t dry,&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>

<p>Bart, who was nearest, turned the knob. The
door did not open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuck, I guess,&rdquo; he said, and gave it a yank.
It moved a bit, but only enough to show that it
was fastened in some way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve locked
us in!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>PLANNING TO ESCAPE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; came from Bart. &ldquo;What in
the world would they do that for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Ned. &ldquo;But you can
see for yourself. The door&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the catch slipped by mistake when
the captain went out,&rdquo; suggested Frank. &ldquo;Give
him a call, or pound on the wall to attract attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me give the door another try,&rdquo; Bart said.
&ldquo;No use making a false alarm. Maybe it&rsquo;s only
stuck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was too evident that the portal was locked.
The knob turned freely, but the bolt was shot and
effectually made the boys prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I pound on the door?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there isn&rsquo;t another way out,&rdquo; suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>They looked all around the room. It was about
ten feet square, and, aside from the table, chairs
and lamp contained no furniture or furnishings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t even a window,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that up there?&rdquo; inquired Fenn, pointing
to some sort of an opening near the ceiling.</p>

<p>Bart climbed up on the table and investigated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a window,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not more
than a foot square, and has bars to it. More for
ventilation than anything else I guess. It&rsquo;s just
above the waterline, for I can hear the river and
the noise of the propeller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be a mistake,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Go
ahead, Bart, and make a racket like a base drum.
We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here, dress and get ashore
somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Bart pounded with both fists on the
door, while the boys aided him by yelling. They
kept it up for several minutes but there was no
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the machinery makes so much noise
they can&rsquo;t hear us,&rdquo; remarked Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all
pound together. Use the chair and save our fists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They raised a thundering din by knocking the
chairs against the walls of the room and the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely someone must hear that,&rdquo; said Bart,
as he stopped to rest his arm. Evidently someone
did, for in the silence that followed a voice
asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to get out,&rdquo; called Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
locked in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well boys, I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; went on the voice,
which they recognized as that of Captain Needham&rsquo;s
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t let you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let us out?&rdquo; demanded Ned.
&ldquo;What right have you got to keep us here, prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of calling you prisoners,&rdquo;
the captain said in a gentle tone from the
other side of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else is it?&rdquo; Bart asked indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re only detained for a little while,
that&rsquo;s all. I can&rsquo;t explain now, but it will be all
right in a few days. I wish I could tell you, but
I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m bound to secrecy. If you will only
be patient I&rsquo;m sure it will be all right inside of a
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you&rsquo;re going to keep us
here a week?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to, you know.
You&rsquo;ll be well taken care of. Plenty to eat, but
I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t give you any better clothes than
those you have on. You can&rsquo;t run away in them,
and you might if you had your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this!&rdquo; threatened Bart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
&ldquo;When we do get out you&rsquo;ll be arrested. You
can&rsquo;t do this sort of thing in this country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have done it,&rdquo; the captain replied, and
the boys thought they heard him laughing.
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get excited. We&rsquo;ll treat you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be treated well!&rdquo; fired back
Frank. &ldquo;We want our rights! We demand
that you release us at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t do it, boys. The best
I can do is to send word to your folks that you are
safe, but unavoidably detained,&rdquo; and this time the
boys were sure the man was laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll break this door down if you don&rsquo;t let us
out!&rdquo; shouted Ned, and he banged a chair against
the portal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have your own troubles doing
that,&rdquo; the captain replied. &ldquo;Go ahead and try.
Now I&rsquo;m going to treat you good. There&rsquo;s another
room opening off from the one where you
are. It has bunks in it, a wash basin, running
water and a few other conveniences. Just imagine
you&rsquo;re on a steamer, taking a trip for a few days,
and it will soon be over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a clicking sound, and a part of the
wall, the boys would never have taken for a door,
slid back and showed a small room adjoining the
one they were in. It had four bunks and a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
washroom, but there was no opening from it save
the same kind of a ventilator that was in the first
apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breakfast will be served to you here in the
morning,&rdquo; the captain called and then the boys
could hear him going away.</p>

<p>For a little while the chums were too surprised
at the sudden turn of affairs to be able to make any
remarks. Then Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the high-handed, piratical proceedings
this is the limit. It&rsquo;s just like a dime
novel, or a five-cent library plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only not half so funny,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;The
folks will be very much worried about us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the captain will keep his word and
send them a message,&rdquo; ventured Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he says we&rsquo;re unavoidably detained that
will make them almost as much worried as if they
didn&rsquo;t hear from us,&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;Boys,
we&rsquo;ve got to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Bart, with something like despair
in his voice.</p>

<p>He might well ask how. Clad in garments
which they could hardly venture out in, with no
shoes, and without so much as a penknife to cut
their way free, their case seemed hopeless. Their
only weapons were the spoons which had been furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with their meal. There were no knives or
forks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it,&rdquo; Bart decided.</p>

<p>Silence fell upon them. They could feel the
boat vibrate with the speed of the engine. They
were still being carried up stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what gets me! I can&rsquo;t understand it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have a sort of clew,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hinges on the same thing that has been a
mystery from the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the King of Paprica?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. At first I thought those men were
crazy. Now I begin to think differently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is their object, and why do they
want to make prisoners of us? What have we
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we have Sandy Merton to thank for
our being locked up,&rdquo; went on Frank. &ldquo;You see
the captain arranged this after Sandy saw us and
ran back to tell Mr. Needham. Sandy has been
on our trail. You remember he was in the canoe.
Then he was on guard there, near where those
men had their hut. You can depend on it there&rsquo;s
a deep mystery here, and, in some way, whether
we know it or not, we&rsquo;re mixed up in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think these men on the boat are,
also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. They&rsquo;re acting for some one, and
they don&rsquo;t want us to get away to give an alarm.
That&rsquo;s as much as I can understand now. If any
of you can get at the bottom of it say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no one could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold in here,&rdquo; remarked Bart.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to crawl in the bunk. These overalls
are rather thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got into one of the narrow beds and the
others followed his example. The light from the
lamp in the other room illuminated the apartment
dimly. The boys talked the situation over from
all sides coming to no conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until morning,&rdquo; suggested Bart.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be rested then, and can think better.
We&rsquo;ll have a look around the place and maybe we
can make a break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a break when they open the door
to give us breakfast,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be a good plan,&rdquo; came from Bart.
&ldquo;The morning will do. We can&rsquo;t accomplish anything
to-night, so there&rsquo;s no use fretting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of their unpleasant position the boys
finally fell asleep and slumbered soundly. Bart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was the first to awaken and he hardly knew where
he was. A glance around soon brought to his
mind what had happened. He hurried into the
other room. As he reached it he gave a cry that
brought his companions in on the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>Bart pointed to the table. The dishes had all
been removed while they slept and the lamp was
gone. A dim light came in through the ventilators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were here in the night!&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s queer about that?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t come in
through the door, as the chairs are in front of it
just as we left them, and the door opens inwardly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t come in through the window, for
there isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did they get in then?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be some secret way that we don&rsquo;t
know about. We must find it. That&rsquo;s how we
can escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s around the ventilators,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a look,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>They soon found that the one in the bunk room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
would not admit the body of a child, to say nothing
to that of a man. The one in the room where
they had eaten was similar. As Bart, standing on
the table, was examining it closely, he motioned to
his companions to make no noise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE ESCAPE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ned in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some men are talking up on deck. I can
hear them,&rdquo; Bart answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>He listened intently for a moment and came
down from the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who they are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t recognize Captain Needham&rsquo;s voice, but one
man was saying: &lsquo;It was a great idea, him calling
himself the King of Paprica. That must have
thrown &rsquo;em all off the scent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only confirms what we guessed at, that the
men on this boat are, in some way, connected with
the mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See any way of getting out around that ventilator?&rdquo;
asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to try the
floor or walls. Say!&rdquo; he went on in an excited
tone. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of it before. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
way that door slid back ought to have given me the
tip. There must be some secret passage in the
walls or floor. Let&rsquo;s look for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excited over the prospect of escape, the boys
carefully examined the walls. They seemed
solid, except where the door slid back to reveal the
bunk room. This was operated from outside, they
decided. There was no way of escape open there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at every inch of the floor!&rdquo; said Bart,
dropping to his knees.</p>

<p>The others followed his example. They
crawled about with their eyes close to the boards.
Suddenly Frank uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo; called Bart, who was in the
bunk room.</p>

<p>For answer Frank pointed to a long, straight
crack in the floor, under the table. It was about
a quarter of an inch wide, and was at right angles
to the other cracks which appeared wherever
the boards joined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s a sliding trap-door!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank. &ldquo;We must try to open it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a knock sounded on the door
and a voice called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you boys will promise to behave and not cut
up rough I&rsquo;ll bring in some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; agreed Bart, his voice trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
slightly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the food,&rdquo; he added
in a whisper to his companions, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll
try to escape to-night. Don&rsquo;t say anything to whoever
comes in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person outside proved to be a husky man
with a big tray of food. Standing behind him in
the passage were two other men, so there would
have been little use in the boys making a dash for
liberty. In silence the food was placed on the
table, and without speaking the man withdrew,
locking the door after him.</p>

<p>The boys waited until the footsteps died away.
They were so excited over the prospect of escape
they did not think of the food. Eagerly they
looked for a knife. There were only spoons.
Ned uttered an exclamation of disappointment,
but Bart seized one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The handle will go into the crack,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Maybe we can shove the door back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried, but was unable to budge the slide, if
it was one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all try,&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>

<p>There were four large spoons. The chums
moved the table so they could kneel side by side
and inserted the handles into the narrow crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All together!&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>The piece of flooring suddenly slid back, revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a flight of steps leading downward into the
hold of the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll show
Captain Needham a trick or two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must wait until night!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;It
will be easier then. Besides, we&rsquo;ll need a lantern
in that dark hole, and they&rsquo;ll bring one with our
suppers. Now I can eat with a good appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can we escape in these clothes?&rdquo; asked
Fenn, looking at his overalls and jumper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so afraid as you are of meeting the
girls,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat now. I wish it
was night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums thought they had never known such
a long day. At noon their dinner was served, the
same precaution being observed as with the breakfast.
With supper the man brought a lantern
which he hung up on a hook in the ceiling. Then
he went out, closing the door and locking it. All
the while the barge had been steaming ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder why they used that trap door to take
the things away by last night?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably to impress us with the mystery of the
thing,&rdquo; answered Bart. &ldquo;Lucky they didn&rsquo;t
close it tight or we&rsquo;d never noticed where it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ate their supper and waited in anxiety until
it would be late enough to make the attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
escape. They wanted to delay until all but the
watchmen would be asleep. At last Bart said he
thought it must be close to midnight. The lantern
was taken down, and, using the spoons, they
slid back the trap door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first with the lantern,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;The rest of you follow. Don&rsquo;t make a bit of
noise. We must make our way to the deck, somehow,
and, as soon as you do, rush for the side and
overboard. We can easily swim ashore. No
matter what kind it is, it&rsquo;s better than being held
here prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about our clothes?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to ask for &rsquo;em, go ahead,&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stop for a full dress suit now.
These togs are good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cautiously Bart began to descend the steps.
The lantern showed a black hold, filled with boxes
and barrels. The others followed, stepping gingerly,
for they were in their bare feet.</p>

<p>Bart looked about for some means of reaching
the deck. Ahead he saw a glimmer of light.
Placing the lantern where it would show him the
way back he went closer. He found the light was
at the head of a companionway which he ascended
and noticed it led to the after part of the barge.
He could feel the cool wind blowing on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; he said, and he went back to
tell his chums.</p>

<p>They made their way up the stairs, pausing to
listen. There was no sound save the throbbing
of the engine and the churn of the screw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see the stars,&rdquo; whispered Ned. &ldquo;This must
lead to the deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did, and two minutes more and they stood at
the side of the barge, ready to leap overboard.
They could see the shore not far away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; said Bart in a low tone.</p>

<p>At that instant a voice called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi there! Come back! Captain, the boys
are escaping!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of feet running across the deck toward
them could be heard. Then, in the light
of a lantern, a man was seen approaching where
the chums stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overboard!&rdquo; yelled Bart.</p>

<p>There were four splashes in the water, and the
four boys were striking out for shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop the barge!&rdquo; This was Captain Needham&rsquo;s
voice calling. &ldquo;Lower a boat! We
mustn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em get away! After &rsquo;em men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a ringing of bells. The water
churned under the stern of the <i>Comet</i> as the engine
was reversed. Then came the sound of a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
being lowered. A few seconds later it struck the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost to shore,&rdquo; called Bart cautiously.
&ldquo;Keep on boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the noise of oars in the rowlocks.
The barge had come to a stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; called Captain Needham. &ldquo;Get
&rsquo;em before they land or we&rsquo;ll have trouble. But
I guess they can&rsquo;t go very far barefooted.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE PURSUIT</h3>


<p>Ned, being the best swimmer, was first ashore.
The others soon joined him. They could dimly
make out the approaching boat in which were several
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way at all,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;To the trees!
If we take a step they&rsquo;ll hear us, and besides, we
don&rsquo;t know any more than the man in the moon
which way to go. Hide in a tree until they give
up the chase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shore was lined with trees. It wasn&rsquo;t much
fun climbing up barefooted, and with thin clothes
on, but the boys managed it, and soon were in a
big willow, the thick leaves of which afforded a
good screen.</p>

<p>They had no sooner perched themselves on limbs,
well hidden by the foliage, than the sound of the
boat&rsquo;s keel grating on the gravelly shore was
heard. Then came the captain&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter now and hunt for &rsquo;em. They can&rsquo;t
have gone far! We were after &rsquo;em too quick!
But be careful men, I don&rsquo;t want those boys hurt.
Be easy, remember!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;In fact this
whole business is queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noise the men made as they crashed through
the underbrush came plainly to the ears of the
boys. They could see the gleam of lanterns the
searchers carried, as they ran to and fro. But
the tree proved a happy thought. None of the
men imagined the boys were in it, and some of the
pursuers even stood beneath the willow and voiced
their remarks of disappointment.</p>

<p>For ten or fifteen minutes the search was kept
up in the vicinity of where the boat had landed.
The men made a circle about the place looking for
the boys but did not find them. The chums,
cramped from clinging to the branches, dared not
move for fear of rustling the leaves, and disclosing
their presence. Finally the searchers gathered
about the boat, close to the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess they gave us the slip,&rdquo; remarked the
captain. &ldquo;Smart lads those. Well, men, might
as well go back. Get the boat ready.&rdquo; The men
moved off, Captain Needham remaining beneath
the tree a moment longer. The boys heard him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
murmur: &ldquo;The King of Paprica will not like
this. I must get word to him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he moved away. A little later the sound
of the boat being hoisted to the barge could be
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get down now?&rdquo; whispered Fenn.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all stiff and cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better wait awhile,&rdquo; advised Bart. &ldquo;They
may have left some one on watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was weary waiting but the boys did not complain.
It was so still they could hear the men in
the small boat boarding the barge. Then there
came the sound of the big craft getting underway.
Bart peered out through the leaves. He could
just make out the steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve turned around! They&rsquo;re heading
down stream!&rdquo; he said in an excited whisper. &ldquo;I
guess we&rsquo;re safe now. Come on, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He scrambled down, followed by the others.</p>

<p>From the shore they could see the lights of the
barge disappearing around a bend in the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be something very queer in this, when
our escape makes them turn around and go back,&rdquo;
spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we were surely mixed up in that
mystery,&rdquo; came from Frank. &ldquo;Wish we knew
how.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;This
thing will have to end in a little while. Now, the
question is, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look for a place to stay the rest of the
night,&rdquo; counseled Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, only I don&rsquo;t feel much like tramping
through the woods and fields in the dark and
barefooted,&rdquo; objected Fenn. &ldquo;Why not stay
here until it&rsquo;s light enough to see where we are
going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After talking it over they decided this was the
best plan. It was too risky tramping about in
an unknown locality, especially without some
protection for their feet. Bart walked back
away from the river. Then he called to his
chums:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hay field, fellows. It&rsquo;s been cut but
hasn&rsquo;t been cocked up yet. Come on, we&rsquo;ll make a
pile of it and crawl in to get warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a good suggestion. The half-cured grass
made a warm nest for the thinly clad boys, and
they huddled down together in a big mound of the
fragrant hay, pulling it over themselves until they
were hidden from sight, leaving only a little hole
to breathe through. It was so warm and comfortable
that they speedily fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sun was shining when they awakened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Bart sprang up, scattering the hay all about, and his
companions followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a bit of breakfast!&rdquo; Fenn remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So say we all of us,&rsquo;&rdquo; chanted Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance of it!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breakfast!&rdquo; and he pointed to a little village
about half a mile away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;re in luck!&rdquo; cried Ned.
&ldquo;Now for a meal and a chance to send word
home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go looking this way!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn. &ldquo;Look at our clothes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean don&rsquo;t look at &rsquo;em,&rdquo; corrected Bart.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hang a sign out; &lsquo;We have better ones
at home.&rsquo; That will satisfy any one. As for me
I&rsquo;d go there and ask for a bite if I only had my
swimming togs on, and these are a heap-sight more
respectable than those. Here goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He strode forward, pulling wisps of hay from
his hair. The others followed. From the field
they emerged into a country road that led to the
village. They were almost at the outskirts of the
hamlet, where several houses were grouped together
when a boy came from one out into the
highway, carrying a pail of milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks good!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;Hi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
kid,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;sell us a drink of milk, will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy halted. He gazed at the four strange
figures approaching; figures clad in ragged overalls
and jumpers; bare-footed figures, with bits of
hay clinging to them. Then the boy dropped his
pail of milk spilling it all over and with a yell of:
&ldquo;Pop! Pop! Here they be!&rdquo; he dashed back
into the house.</p>

<p>The next moment three men came from the
house. They carried clubs in their hands, and one
had a gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; called one, as the three advanced
on the run toward the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polite way to receive guests,&rdquo; commented
Bart.</p>

<p>As he spoke there came hurrying from houses
adjoining that where the boy lived who gave the
alarm, a number of men and youths. All of them
had clubs or some sort of weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to be after us!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are!&rdquo; admitted Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Captain
Needham lied about us and put them on our
track. He probably sent some message last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better run,&rdquo; counseled Frank, and at
that the boys took to their heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>The pursuit was on in earnest. The crowd behind
kept increasing as men and youths from
houses further back on the road joined it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch &rsquo;em! Stop &rsquo;em! Head &rsquo;em off!&rdquo; were
the cries that reached the boys. But they kept on
at their best speed. They had the advantage of a
good start, and were not hampered with heavy
clothing and shoes. The road was deep in dust
and was not hard on their unprotected feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never catch us!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.
&ldquo;But what in the world do they want with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk! Run!&rdquo; came from Fenn.</p>

<p>It began to look as though the boys would get
away. The road stretched invitingly before them,
and, though the number of their pursuers was increasing
they had not cut down the lads&rsquo; lead much.
But fortune does not always favor the brave. As
the chums went around a curve they saw in front
of them a load of hay, overturned on the highway.
It blocked the whole width of the road, save
for a strip of sward on either side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go around it!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>But when they came up they found the passage
on both sides was so thick with big Canadian
thistles, as to daunt even the bravest barefooted
person, particularly if he had not been used to
going without his shoes. They gingerly tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
passage on either side but had to turn back. The
pursuers gave a shout and came on faster than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the hay!&rdquo; sung out Ned.</p>

<p>He made a running jump to scramble up the
small hill of dried grass. The others followed.
From the other side there suddenly appeared the
farmer who owned it. He had been trying to
fix his wagon. He saw the boys attempting to
climb over the load, and noted the crowd in pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he yelled, making a grab
for Fenn and Bart, who were in the rear. He
seized them by their loose clothing. As the two
boys felt themselves being pulled back they instinctively
grabbed at Ned and Frank. All four
fell in a heap on the highway at the bottom of the
hay pile. An instant later the crowd was upon
them and the boys were grabbed by half a dozen
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exclaimed one gray-bearded
man, with a big tin star on his coat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git
th&rsquo; reward. Great luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right have you got to chase us?&rdquo; demanded
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best right in the world,&rdquo; replied the constable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we done?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broke jail, that&rsquo;s what ye done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broke jail! We never were in jail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Ain&rsquo;t ye th&rsquo; two men who escaped
from Blissville jail last night?&rdquo; demanded the
constable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; fairly shouted Bart. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
count? There are four of us and mere boys, not
men. The only place we broke from was the
hold of the barge where they were keeping us
prisoners, after we fell from the balloon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balloon!&rdquo; exclaimed another man, coming
forward from the crowd. &ldquo;Are you th&rsquo; boys
from Darewell th&rsquo; alarm has been sent out for?
Went up in a balloon that broke away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who we are,&rdquo; replied Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heck! men, we&rsquo;ve got th&rsquo; wrong ones!&rdquo;
cried the man who had last spoken. &ldquo;These are
the balloon boys! It was two men, not four boys,
who broke jail! We&rsquo;ve made a mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made ye run, if ye wasn&rsquo;t guilty?&rdquo; demanded
the constable, rather incensed over his
disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;d run, Amos,&rdquo; put in the other
man, &ldquo;if ye saw this crowd after ye.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</h3>


<p>It took considerable explanation to set things
straight but it was finally accomplished. The
boys told as much of their story as they thought
proper, from the time they went up in the balloon
until they saw the crowd after them.</p>

<p>In turn they were informed that during the
night two prisoners had escaped from the jail at
Blissville, the next town to Pentkirk, which was
the village they were then in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky you mentioned balloon,&rdquo; spoke Mr.
Weldon, the farmer who had come to the chum&rsquo;s
aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear of it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess! Circulars describin&rsquo; ye have
been sent to every postoffice around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Captain Needham hasn&rsquo;t telephoned
word to our folks!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;We must do
it at once. Is there a wire in town?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, an&rsquo; ye can use it all ye want to,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Mr. Weldon. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hundred dollars reward
for news of each of ye, an&rsquo; maybe ye
wouldn&rsquo;t mind lettin&rsquo; some of th&rsquo; boys earn it by
telephonin&rsquo; t&rsquo; th&rsquo; Darewell police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Bart, &ldquo;so long as our
folks are told, at once, that&rsquo;s all we care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like some breakfast and&mdash;and&mdash;some
decent clothes too,&rdquo; put in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see to that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weldon.
&ldquo;Come along with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the boys to his house, first sending a
messenger to telephone to Darewell that the boys
were safe and would shortly be home. The
chums were soon eating a hearty meal, and then
were fitted out in garments, which, if they did not
fit them well, being collected from several houses
that contained lads about of their age, were a
welcome relief from the overalls and jumpers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew how much depended on shoes
before,&rdquo; said Fenn, as he gazed at those loaned
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can feel those thistles yet,&rdquo; observed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I s&rsquo;pose you boys&rsquo;ll want t&rsquo; git home,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Weldon when breakfast was finished.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad t&rsquo; advance ye th&rsquo; money for your
tickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be much obliged if you will,&rdquo; spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Bart. &ldquo;If you want references you can telephone
to any one in Darewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them circulars is reference enough,&rdquo; was the
answer, as he waved one containing a description
of the boys. Their relatives had sent them broadcast
after the balloon had broken loose and no
word had been received from the chums by the
following morning.</p>

<p>It was not long before the four were on a
train, speeding home. They were so full of talk
over their recent experiences that it was hard to
say where one began and the other left off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing we&rsquo;ve got to do the minute we
get back,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make a trip to that place where
we saw the men acting so queerly, where Sandy
was on guard, and where that log cabin was, and
see what it all means. We&rsquo;ll have those men
arrested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Captain Needham, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in the plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys arrived home about noon. That
they were welcomed by their parents, relatives and
friends is putting it mildly. There was a big
crowd at the depot, as the train got in, and there
was a regular procession up the main street, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the boys in the center. Such shouting, laughing
and cheering was seldom heard in Darewell before,
and the next issue of the town paper was
hardly large enough to give even a partial account
of what happened.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys were released by their
friends, which took considerable time, there was
a consultation at Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>It was attended by the four boys, Frank&rsquo;s
uncle, Mr. Keene and Mr. Masterson. The lads
told their story from the start, beginning with
their first encounter with the King of Paprica.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are just two ways about it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wilding. &ldquo;Those men are either crazy or they
are criminals, up to some game. In either case
they ought to be driven from the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others agreed with him. Then they discussed
a plan. It was decided that the boys, accompanied
by Mr. Wilding, the chief of police
and an officer, should go to the clearing at the
foot of Bender&rsquo;s hill, and see if any of the men
were still there. If they were they were to be
arrested, and held until they made a satisfactory
explanation.</p>

<p>The little posse started about three o&rsquo;clock that
afternoon, the matter being kept quiet. The two
police officers were armed. The boys wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
take their rifles, but were not allowed to, as
their parents did not want them to run any
chances.</p>

<p>The chief of police and his officer led the way
through the woods and across the fields to the location
described by the boys. They went cautiously,
keeping a lookout for any signs of the
strangely-acting men.</p>

<p>As they advanced through a little glade, close
to where the clearing was located, the chief, who
was in advance, called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one sitting on the ground just
ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart pressed forward. He saw a lad leaning
against a big stake driven into the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s Jimmie Nelson!&rdquo; Bart exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The laziest boy in town,&rdquo; murmured the
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up and speak to him,&rdquo; Bart went on.
&ldquo;You can hang back here until I see what he&rsquo;s
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing? He never does anything,&rdquo; said
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jimmie,&rdquo; called Bart, as he started to
cross the clearing. &ldquo;What you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call that a job; sitting there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s a nice easy job. Sandy got it for
me. He&rsquo;s working for the same firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart gave a sudden start. The plot, it seemed,
was thickening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your duties?&rdquo; Bart went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I just sit here to watch that this stake
don&rsquo;t move, and if I see any one coming I&rsquo;m to
pull this string.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you pulled it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, ain&rsquo;t seen any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I almost forgot. Say, pull it,
will you; you&rsquo;re nearer to it than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The string was about two inches from Jim&rsquo;s
hand, and within one inch of Bart&rsquo;s foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens if I pull it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. That ain&rsquo;t part of my job,&rdquo;
and Jim blinked his eyes lazily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll not pull it,&rdquo; replied Bart,
putting his foot on the cord to prevent Jim from
doing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, maybe I&rsquo;ll lose my job now, but
I don&rsquo;t care. There&rsquo;s too much work. Have to
stay awake too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart turned and beckoned to his companions
who had remained in the woods. They came on
in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to come here,&rdquo; Jim objected
in a lazy tone. &ldquo;I ought to pull that
string. Pull it, Bart, you&rsquo;re closer than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; exclaimed the chief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see
where this cord leads!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to trace the white string that
stretched along the ground and into the woods
beyond the clearing. The boys followed, and
the party broke into a run. Bart carried the end
of the cord with him to prevent Jim from pulling
it, but he need not have taken the trouble as Jim
had gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Just as the posse was at the further edge of the
clearing there emerged from the woods four men.
One was the white-bearded individual, whose
strange language and actions had first aroused the
boys&rsquo; suspicions, one the tramp, whom the chums
had encountered three times; the third was the
man who had taken Sandy&rsquo;s gun that day, while
at the sight of the fourth Frank exclaimed:
&ldquo;The King of Paprica!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men stopped abruptly on seeing the boys
and their companions. There was a moment&rsquo;s
silence and then a noise sounded off to the left.
They all turned to behold Captain Needham approaching
on the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boys got away!&rdquo; he cried, addressing the
King of Paprica.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>STRIKING OIL&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! They did!&rdquo; exclaimed the
chief of police. &ldquo;They got away from you, and
they&rsquo;re here now to prefer charges against you
and the other scoundrels. I place you all under
arrest,&rdquo; and he drew his revolver, the officer doing
likewise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no necessity for that,&rdquo; said the man
who had called himself the King of Paprica.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to make any trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; said the chief significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can explain it all now,&rdquo; the man went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About kidnaping these boys?&rdquo; demanded
Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kidnap &rsquo;em,&rdquo; spoke Captain Needham,
&ldquo;they came aboard and were glad enough
to. I had to hold &rsquo;em a while, and sorry enough
I was to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorrier before we&rsquo;re through with
you,&rdquo; remarked the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, perhaps I had better explain,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the man whom the boys had seen wearing the gilt
crown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you a chance,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place we owe you boys an apology,&rdquo;
the man went on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it a substantial
one too, as you will see, but first let me introduce
myself. My name is Patrick Ricka, and I am
interested in oil wells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oil wells!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Wilding.
&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t but there will be very soon,&rdquo;
Mr. Ricka added. &ldquo;My companions are William
Hendershot,&rdquo; and he indicated the man with
the white beard, &ldquo;Joseph Gampfer,&rdquo; who was
the tramp, &ldquo;and Andrew Maddox. They are
associated with me in this enterprise. Captain
Needham, I believe, you boys know,&rdquo; and he
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy or is it a joke about the King
of Paprica?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilding, not inclined
to let up on the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an odd title, made up partly from my
own name, as you will observe, and adopted to
meet the exigencies of the occasion. For some
time I have suspected there was oil in this region,&rdquo;
Patrick Ricka continued. &ldquo;I knew if I
made any tests openly some one would find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
what I was after, and I would have no opportunity
of securing the land without paying a fabulous
price for it. So I decided to come here with my
assistants and work in secret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought the best plan would be to pretend
one or more of us was slightly insane and
that the other was his keeper. This was done.
I had the hut (a portable one) built and placed
the name above the door to further the idea that
we were insane. Then we went through some
rather foolish antics, just to keep persons from
prying around here. You boys were the more
persistent, and saw more of us than any one else.
That day Mr. Hendershot was poking his pole
down in the river he was testing to see if there
was a strata of oil land under the water. You
boys thought he was crazy. Again, when you
started to cross here and Sandy ordered you away,
we were making some microscopic tests of the upper
surface, and did not want to be disturbed.
We hired Sandy, not because we liked him, but
because we heard he was on the &lsquo;outs&rsquo; with you
boys, and we knew he would not make friends
with you and so unintentionally perhaps, give our
secret away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it happened the plan was successful in a
measure. Then Mr. Gampfer in the guise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a tramp met you and inquired where the cabin
was, for he had, up to that time, not been to it.
He saw you were rather dangerous boys to have
loose, as far as our plans were concerned. Even
moving the cabin did not fool you. We saw you
with the telescope that day,&rdquo; and Mr. Ricka
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Sandy and Mr. Gampfer follow
us for?&rdquo; demanded Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to see if they could overhear what you
were talking about, and learn whether you were
still determined to solve our secret,&rdquo; replied the
oil man. &ldquo;They intended no harm, and, I trust,
worked none. If they had heard you discussing
ways of finding out our secret they would have
warned me to hasten matters to a close. I hope
they did not annoy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It worried us,&rdquo; Bart replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. We are sorry for that. In the
meanwhile we went on with our experiments.
We found indications that oil was plentiful under
here and made arrangements to buy the property.
But we paid a good price for it, and each seller
will have a share in the profits. We did nothing
dishonest. Mr. Gampfer gave you a tip, once,
but you didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The day you borrowed the salt,&rdquo; replied the
man who had posed as a tramp. &ldquo;You see I was
engaged in going through the country around here
with my instruments looking for indications of oil.
You asked me what my work was and I said
hunting the &lsquo;Oilander Tincander.&rsquo; If you will
say that slowly you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oil-ander Tin-can-der,&rdquo; murmured Bart.
&ldquo;Oh! I see. Oil-can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Ricka, &ldquo;everything
went along well until that balloon trip. That
brought about the climax. Of course it was all
an accident, and we had no idea our barge would
pick you boys from the river. You see we have
a barge to bring machinery to us. It had delivered
some and was to bring more. It was on
the way after it when the balloon fell. Sandy
Merton, whom we kept in our employ, was aboard
and recognized you boys. He told Captain Needham,
who, knowing how nearly you had discovered
our secret, determined to hold you a while
until he could let me know. He had no right
to, of course, and we will pay you any reasonable
damages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you see we have struck oil,&rdquo; Mr. Ricka
went on. &ldquo;Our property which extends for over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a mile all around Bender&rsquo;s hill, is rich in oil.
As soon as you boys escaped Captain Needham
turned about and came back. I apprehend that
is correct, Captain, for, though he sent a telegram
to me telling of your&mdash;er&mdash;of your detention&mdash;I
have not seen him from shortly before the
balloon fell, until this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Needham nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The need of secrecy is at an end,&rdquo; Mr. Ricka
continued. &ldquo;Our rights are all secured and we
don&rsquo;t care how soon everyone in Darewell knows
about the oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Jimmie Nelson doing out there?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of Sandy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied the oil
man. &ldquo;We hired him to stay out there and pull
the string, which rings a bell in the cabin, as soon
as he saw any one. We knew he was lazy, and
this was the easiest and safest job we could think
of for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep now,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. Well, there&rsquo;s no need for him
any longer. I guess we&rsquo;ll discharge him. Now
as to you boys. I realize we had no right to detain
you, and you doubtless suffered some hardships.
Will a thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of valuable
oil stock apiece satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the stock any good?&rdquo; asked Bart quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Wilding can answer that,&rdquo; and
Mr. Ricka showed the bank cashier some certificates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good as gold,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you boys accept it?&rdquo; asked the oil man.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t stock in these new wells, but in some
long established ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys and Mr. Wilding consulted together
for a moment. The boys were only too willing
to call the matter square on that basis, and the
cashier gave his consent to the deal, as regarded his
own son, after demanding that Mr. Ricka also pay
the reward, which was done. The other chums
were sure their relatives would not object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that is settled, come and see the first
well we have sunk,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Ricka. &ldquo;It
is not finished, but we know it is going to be a
success, for we have tested it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way to a little clearing beyond the
big one. In front of the cabin was some curious
machinery. There were a number of tanks and
barrels, which smelled strongly of oil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you connect the dynamo?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Ricka of Captain Needham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just before I left the barge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we get our power from a dynamo on
the barge,&rdquo; the oil man explained. &ldquo;A wire runs
from here to the boat, through the woods. We
didn&rsquo;t dare risk taking power from town or some
one would find out what we were up to. The
barge not only brought us our supplies but gave
us electricity for an experimental plant. We&rsquo;ll
soon have a larger one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he showed the visitors where a small well
had been bored by means of new and improved
electrical machinery. It gave a good quality of
oil, and there were indications that the under strata
was permeated with the valuable fluid.</p>

<p>In fact the new oil company proved a big success,
and several land owners in the vicinity made
small fortunes. Frank&rsquo;s uncle was one of the
lucky ones, though his share was not as large as
was some of his neighbors&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The boys&rsquo; relatives decided to let the matter
drop, in consideration of the settlement made by
Mr. Ricka. Soon there was a big boom in town,
caused by the knowledge that oil had been struck.
A number of persons found employment with the
company, Sandy Merton being one of them. Jim
Nelson might have been hired, but he was too
lazy to ask for a job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Letter for you, Ned,&rdquo; said his chums one
day about a week later, as they were all in the
postoffice, for Bart had glanced in the Wilding
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder who it&rsquo;s from?&rdquo; spoke Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best way to find out is to open it,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn, and the hesitating boy forthwith followed
his friend&rsquo;s advice.</p>

<p>It was a short epistle, and Ned had soon finished
reading it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my uncle and aunt in New York,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They want me to pay them a long
visit next vacation, and I can bring some friends
with me. Will you fellows go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To New York? Well, I guess yes!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart, and the others nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can have corking times!&rdquo; Ned went on.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been there. It&rsquo;s great, according to
what you read about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have much more excitement than
we did right here the last few weeks,&rdquo; remarked
Fenn.</p>

<p>But whether the boys did or not can be learned
in the second volume of this series, which will be
entitled: &ldquo;Ned Wilding&rsquo;s Disappearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it was time to go now,&rdquo; Ned went on
as he put the letter in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to wait, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;By
the way, what ever became of John Newton, who
used to work here as a messenger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Did he get to be assistant postmaster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Went to New York last week,&rdquo; Fenn added,
for John lived near him. &ldquo;Said he was going
to be an actor or get some sort of a job on the
stage. Wouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what he went in
some variety show. He could imitate birds better
than any one I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see him when we go to New
York,&rdquo; suggested Bart.</p>

<p>There, as they discussed the possibilities of their
trip, which was destined to be much more surprising
than any of them supposed, we will take
leave of them.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
